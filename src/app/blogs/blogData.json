      "bodyText": "<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of workplace culture, the inclusion of neurodivergent individuals is emerging as a cornerstone for innovation and safety. The latest episode of Neurodivergent Mates podcast features Catherine Lee, a seasoned expert in occupational health and safety with a particular focus on the neurodivergent community. Throughout the episode, we traverse the multifaceted world of neurodiversity in the workplace, illuminating the need for environments that not only acknowledge but also celebrate cognitive differences.</p><p>Catherine's journey began with a strong foundation in nursing, a career path rooted in care and prevention. Her transition into occupational health was fueled by the desire to mitigate workplace injuries and cultivate employee well-being. This commitment led to her consultancy work at the executive level, where she champions the integration of safety protocols and the promotion of health in corporate strategies. Particularly intriguing is her ongoing research on ADHD within the aviation industry, a critical look at how neurodivergence affects safety-sensitive roles.</p><p>The discussion takes a personal turn as we hear stories that reveal the profound impact neurodiversity has on daily operations and the well-being of employees. A mother's concern for her autistic and epileptic daughter's workplace safety serves as a powerful testament to the urgent need for inclusive policies. The episode also features a harrowing account of an ADHD colleague's accident, shedding light on the lack of support for neurodivergent individuals in traditional workplace structures. These narratives underscore the necessity of tailored communication and health and safety measures that consider the unique needs of each employee.</p><p>As the conversation unfolds, we are reminded that neurodivergence is not an anomaly; it's estimated that one in ten workers is neurodivergent. This prevalence calls for a reevaluation of standard workplace practices and a pivot towards a more person-centered, strength-based approach. Employers bear the responsibility of crafting safe spaces that not only prevent discrimination but also empower neurodivergent workers to thrive. The episode discusses how person-centered approaches, like in the case of an autistic worker's aversion to full-face masks, can lead to better safety outcomes than disciplinary actions.</p><p>In a particularly enlightening segment, the podcast explores the intersection of neurodiversity and technology. The use of alternative communication methods, such as video blogs, caters to the diverse learning styles present in the workforce. This adaptability not only aligns with safety regulations but also enriches employee engagement. While there is resistance to non-traditional communication methods, Catherine emphasizes the potential of AI to further tailor workplace safety practices.</p><p>The final chapters of the podcast touch on the power of leveraging the unique perspectives of neurodivergent individuals. It's not just about compliance with legal standards; it's about understanding that neurodiversity can drive innovation and efficiency. Through anecdotes and strategies, Catherine Lee paints a vivid picture of a workplace where neurodivergent talents are not just included but nurtured for the collective benefit of the organization.</p><p>In closing, the episode does more than just spotlight the challenges faced by neurodivergent workers; it offers tangible solutions and calls for action. The Neurodivergent Mates podcast invites listeners to join the conversation, encouraging a shift in mindset towards a future where workplace safety and inclusivity are synonymous. Catherine Lee's insights provide a beacon for employers and employees alike, advocating for a world where every mind is valued, and every workplace is a sanctuary of support and growth.</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p>In a world that often seeks conformity, embracing neurodiversity stands as a testament to the beauty and richness of human variation. Neurodiversity encompasses a range of neurological differences, including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and more. Rather than viewing these differences as deficits, the neurodiversity movement celebrates them as unique expressions of human cognition and experience. At the heart of this movement lies the importance of building a community grounded in authentic connection.</p><p>Authentic connection serves as the cornerstone of any meaningful community. It transcends surface-level interactions and delves into the depths of genuine understanding and empathy. For individuals with neurodiverse traits, authentic connection can be especially transformative. It provides a safe space where they can be their true selves without fear of judgment or rejection.</p><p>One of the key benefits of building a neurodiversity community based on authentic connection is the sense of belonging it fosters. All too often, individuals with neurodiverse traits experience feelings of isolation and alienation due to their differences. By coming together in a supportive community, they find validation and acceptance among peers who share similar experiences.</p><p>Moreover, authentic connection facilitates the exchange of experiences, resources, and support within the neurodiversity community. Through open and honest dialogue, individuals can learn from one another, gain valuable insights, and access the tools they need to navigate the challenges they face. Whether it's sharing coping strategies for sensory sensitivities or recommending accommodations in the workplace, the collective wisdom of the community is a powerful resource.</p><p>In addition to practical support, authentic connection also plays a crucial role in challenging stigma and misconceptions surrounding neurodiversity. By sharing their stories and advocating for acceptance, members of the community can educate others and promote greater understanding and inclusivity. Through empathy and compassion, they break down barriers and pave the way for a more equitable society.</p><p>Authentic connection is not just about what we say, but also how we listen. Active listening is a fundamental skill that fosters deeper understanding and empathy. By truly listening to the experiences and perspectives of neurodiverse individuals, we validate their lived realities and honor the diversity of human experience. In doing so, we cultivate a culture of mutual respect and appreciation within the community.</p><p>Furthermore, authentic connection promotes self-discovery and personal growth. In an environment where individuals are free to express themselves authentically, they are empowered to explore their strengths, passions, and interests without fear of judgment. By embracing their neurodiverse traits as integral aspects of their identity, they can harness their unique talents and contributions to make a positive impact on the world.</p><p>Building a neurodiversity community grounded in authentic connection requires intentional effort and commitment. It begins with creating safe and inclusive spaces where individuals feel valued and respected for who they are. This may involve establishing support groups, organizing events, or fostering online communities where people can connect and share their experiences.</p><p>Additionally, it's essential to prioritize accessibility and accommodation to ensure that all members of the community can participate fully. This may include providing sensory-friendly environments, offering alternative communication methods, or implementing flexible scheduling options. By removing barriers to participation, we ensure that everyone has the opportunity to contribute and thrive.</p><p>Ultimately, embracing neurodiversity and building a community through authentic connection enriches us all. It challenges us to expand our understanding of what it means to be human and invites us to celebrate the beauty of our differences. By coming together in solidarity and support, we create a world where everyone is valued, accepted, and empowered to reach their full potential.</p>",

This episode is a clarion call for open dialogue, shedding light on the diverse experiences and often misunderstood paths of those struggling with these conditions.</p><p>As the episode concludes, Lindsay and the hosts, Will Wheeler and Photon John Kev, emphasize the importance of family dynamics and relationships in the recovery process. They advocate for non-critical support and open communication, especially for neurodivergent individuals who may be more sensitive to criticism and isolation. Understanding and empathy are underscored as vital components in supporting someone through an eating disorder, particularly when considering the possibility of neurodivergence.</p><p>The conversation with Lindsay Keating is more than just an episode; it is a powerful reminder of the resilience and diverse tapestry of experiences within the neurodivergent community. Her mission to foster inclusive athletic and nutritional healing is a testament to the positive impact that understanding and tailored community programs can have. This episode not only champions the beauty of differences but also the significance of forging understanding and support within families and communities. It is an invitation to embrace neurodiversity and become advocates for change in our own spheres of influence.</p><p>In summary, this episode provides a compelling and comprehensive examination of the intersection of neurodiversity and eating disorders. It serves as a critical resource for anyone looking to understand the challenges faced by the neurodivergent community and the pathways to healing and support through inclusive sports and community engagement.</p>",

In our recent podcast episode, we sat down to unravel the complexities of living and thriving with ADHD and beyond. The conversation was an enlightening exploration of personal and professional growth, viewed through the lens of neurodiversity.</p><p>Neurodivergent individuals often navigate a world that's not tailored to their unique way of processing information. For instance, routines that seem mundane to some can pose significant challenges to those with ADHD. It's not merely about adjusting to the societal norms but finding a harmonious balance that honors one's intrinsic needs while still allowing for personal evolution. During the podcast we shed light on the importance of self-acceptance and the delicate act of stepping outside one's comfort zone to discover and harness unexpected talents.</p><p>The journey of a neurodivergent entrepreneur is not a linear path, but one filled with unseen victories that often go unnoticed by the outside world. Our discussion ventured into the realm of entrepreneurship, where traditional networking and investment strategies can seem like foreign concepts. Yet, by nurturing authenticity and aligning with like-minded individuals, neurodivergent entrepreneurs can carve out spaces where profitability and social impact coalesce. This narrative emphasizes the power of community and the strength found in embracing one's neurodiversity as an asset rather than a hindrance.</p><p>In celebrating the 50th episode of our podcast coming up, we also delved into the more subtle aspects of neurodivergent lives, such as volunteering and advocating for sensory-friendly environments. Photon John Kev recounted personal experiences, illustrating how volunteering opened doors to new connections and community support. He highlighted the transformative power of stepping into unfamiliar territories, not just for personal gain but for the enrichment of society at large.</p><p>Creating supportive environments for neurodivergent individuals is an ongoing dialogue between personal advocacy and societal education. The episode underscored the need for spaces that accommodate sensory preferences and the critical role of friends and family in understanding and supporting these needs. As neurodivergent individuals unmask and navigate social situations, the conversation turned towards the importance of unapologetically prioritizing one's well-being.</p><p>As we continue to champion the neurodivergent experience, it's vital to have open conversations that foster inclusivity. Our podcast serves as a platform to amplify the voices of those who might otherwise go unheard, and to illuminate the multifaceted experiences of neurodivergent individuals. By sharing these stories, we hope to pave the way for a more empathetic and understanding society.</p><p>In conclusion, the latest episode of our podcast is a heartfelt tribute to the neurodivergent community, offering a window into the lives of those who see the world differently. We invite listeners to immerse themselves in the rich tapestry of neurodiversity and to join us in celebrating the unique strengths and contributions of every individual on the spectrum.</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p>By Will Wheeler – Neurodiversity Academy | Open Hearted Podcast</p><p>On a recent episode of the Open Hearted Podcast, we were joined by Natalie Phillip-Mason — a seasoned change management expert and passionate neurodiversity advocate — to explore a powerful and often overlooked topic: the role of allies in the neurodiversity movement.</p><p>It was a conversation filled with real-life experience, practical advice, and a call to action — not just for neurodivergent individuals, but for allies who want to walk the path with us.</p><h2>Why Allies Matter More Than Ever</h2><p>Building a neuro-inclusive world isn’t a one-sided effort. Neurodivergent people bring lived experience, but it’s our neurotypical allies who often hold the keys to creating systemic, lasting change — especially in workplaces, education, and leadership roles.</p><p>Often, allies want to help but are unsure how — worried about using the wrong terminology, asking the wrong question, or being misunderstood. And in some cases, they’ve been met with hostility or criticism. That’s why it’s so important to lead with compassion, not correction.</p><p>We need allies who are not just aware — but engaged, empowered, and educated.</p><h2>Lived Experience at the Core</h2><p>No one can explain what it’s like to live with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, or any other neurotype better than someone who experiences it daily. That lived experience is invaluable — but allies can play a vital role in amplifying those voices and helping to turn insight into action.</p><p>Natalie shared her journey as both a mother of two neurodivergent daughters and a professional in change management. Her understanding of people, learning styles, and behaviour has helped bridge the gap between personal insight and professional impact.</p><p>She pointed out the clear synergy between effective change management and neuro-inclusion. Both require awareness of different communication styles, learning preferences, and behavioural nuances. In short, it’s about understanding people.</p><h2>Where Organisations Are Starting in the Wrong Place</h2><p>Too many companies are jumping straight into neurodivergent hiring initiatives without building the foundations to support inclusion.</p><p>It’s great to create new opportunities, but if the workplace isn’t set up to support neurodivergent individuals — whether or not they’ve disclosed — we risk creating more harm than good.</p><p>Recruitment is just one part of the picture. Real inclusion is built on culture, systems, communication, and understanding.</p><h2>Media Representation: A Blessing and a Barrier</h2><p>Shows like Love on the Spectrum and Heartbreak High are doing valuable work by starting conversations about neurodivergence. When autistic actors are involved and consulted, it helps move the needle on representation.</p><p>But it’s important to acknowledge their limits. These shows often represent a small part of a much larger, more diverse community. Neurodivergence looks different from person to person. We can’t assume a Netflix series gives us the full story.</p><p>We need to continue expanding the narrative — one that includes creatives, professionals, introverts, extroverts, tech minds, artistic souls, and everything in between.</p><h2>What Needs to Change (and How Allies Can Help)</h2><p>We asked Natalie what we really need to be doing. Her response? Start with education. Build partnerships. Focus on people, not processes. Here are some takeaways:</p><ul><li>Create safe spaces for honest dialogue – People need to feel safe asking questions without judgement.</li><li>Educate leaders before recruiting – Build internal capacity before bringing in new talent.</li><li>Share lived experiences from all levels of an organisation – From interns to executives.</li><li>Support creativity, not just coding – Don’t limit neurodivergence to the tech sector.</li><li>Redefine what workplace success looks like – Move away from rigid expectations and embrace flexibility.</li></ul><h2>Don’t Forget the Creative Side</h2><p>While tech roles often get all the attention, creative industries are full of neurodivergent brilliance. Natalie spoke about her own family’s involvement in the arts and how theatre, music, and design can be incredible outlets for neurodistinct minds.</p><p>We need to stop assuming neurodivergent talent = math genius or data whiz.

      "bodyText": "<p>In a world where learning continues to evolve, assistive technology is emerging as a powerful tool to break down barriers in education. On this episode of the Open Hearted Podcast, host Will Wheeler and co-host Photon John sit down with Tor Ghai, the founder of TorTalk, to discuss the critical role assistive technology plays in supporting neurodivergent learners—particularly those with dyslexia and ADHD. What follows is a deep dive into the practical, emotional, and technical sides of creating inclusive learning environments through innovative digital tools.</p><p><strong>From Personal Struggle to Innovation</strong></p><p>Tor Ghai, a Swedish entrepreneur diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD, knows firsthand the challenges of navigating education as a neurodivergent learner. Throughout his life, he encountered barriers that many in the neurodivergent community know all too well—difficulty retaining information from text, slow reading speeds, and the emotional toll of not being able to keep up with peers. But instead of accepting those limitations, Tor decided to create something that could change lives.</p><p>Tor’s experience led him to develop TorTalk—a user-friendly, high-speed text-to-speech software designed with the needs of neurodivergent individuals at its core. What makes TorTalk unique is that it's built by someone who truly understands the problem. Tor didn’t just build the tool—he lives by it, using it to manage his own learning and professional work every day.</p><p><strong>What Is TorTalk and How Does It Work?</strong></p><p>TorTalk is an assistive text-to-speech application that enables users to select any digital text—on a website, in a PDF, or even on an image—and have it read aloud instantly. It provides a small, intuitive floating toolbar that can be used to play, pause, and adjust the reading speed without navigating away from your task. This makes it ideal for students, educators, researchers, and professionals alike.</p><p>One of its standout features is the ability to skip over citations and parenthetical content—an innovation especially helpful when reading academic papers. For neurodivergent students, this helps reduce cognitive overload and allows them to focus on the core content, improving both comprehension and retention.</p><p><strong>Barriers in Education for Neurodivergent Learners</strong></p><p>Traditional education systems often fail to accommodate neurodivergent learners. These students are typically required to process large volumes of written information daily, a task that can be mentally and emotionally exhausting for those with dyslexia, ADHD, or other learning differences. Unfortunately, this often results in them being mislabeled as lazy or incapable—labels that can have long-term impacts on their confidence and academic outcomes.</p><p>Assistive technology helps dismantle these barriers. By providing equitable access to content, students are no longer defined by how fast they can read but by how well they understand and apply what they've learned. For many, this marks the first time they feel truly capable in an academic setting.</p><p><strong>Confidence Through Accessibility</strong></p><p>Co-host Will Wheeler shared his personal experience using assistive technology, explaining how TorTalk empowered him to engage with dense research articles that he previously would have avoided. By making the reading experience smoother and less mentally taxing, tools like TorTalk not only help with academic performance but also significantly boost confidence.</p><p>Confidence in one's ability to succeed is a crucial driver of long-term success. When neurodivergent learners feel supported and capable, they are more likely to participate, contribute, and take on leadership roles—both in school and in life.</p><p><strong>Assistive Tech in Higher Education and Beyond</strong></p><p>Assistive technology isn’t just an academic tool—it’s a lifelong resource. As students transition into the workforce, the skills and tools they’ve relied on continue to serve them. For example, many professionals use TorTalk to review long emails, documents, or even meeting transcripts on the go.</p><p>Employers are also beginning to see the benefits of neurodiverse teams. But inclusion starts with access, and that’s where tools like TorTalk come in. They enable neurodivergent employees to perform at their best by reducing barriers in communication and information processing.</p><p><strong>Why Don’t More Schools Use Assistive Tech?</strong></p><p>Despite its benefits, many educational institutions still fail to implement assistive technology. One common barrier is lack of awareness among educators and decision-makers. Others may see it as an ‘extra’ rather than an essential component of inclusive education.</p><p>Tor explains that often, these tools are purchased without proper training or involvement from the end users—students themselves. To ensure effectiveness, it's vital that assistive tech is co-designed or tested with neurodivergent individuals, ensuring that their voices are reflected in the product design.</p><p><strong>What’s Next for Assistive Technology?</strong></p><p>With rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, the future of assistive technology is bright. AI can summarise documents, translate speech in real time, and even convert speech into notes. These features have the potential to revolutionise education for students of all backgrounds—not just neurodivergent ones.</p><p>Tor shared how he frequently uses ChatGPT to structure ideas that might otherwise feel scattered due to ADHD. This collaborative workflow enables clearer communication, faster content creation, and improved self-expression—all of which are essential for success in today’s digital world.</p><p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p><p>Assistive technology is not a luxury—it’s a necessity. For millions of neurodivergent learners around the world, tools like TorTalk are a lifeline. They create opportunities where there were once obstacles and open doors that were previously shut. It’s time we stop asking whether assistive technology is needed and start asking how we can implement it more effectively.</p><p>If we want to build truly inclusive classrooms, workplaces, and communities, assistive technology must be part of the equation. And thanks to innovators like Tor Ghai, the future of accessible education looks more promising than ever.</p><p>To hear the full conversation, check out the Neurodivergent Mates Podcast, available now on Spotify and major platforms.</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p><strong>Introduction: Understanding Dyspraxia Beyond the Labels</strong></p><p>Dyspraxia is often overlooked in conversations about neurodiversity, yet it impacts up to 6% of the population. Many still associate it simply with clumsiness or poor coordination, but dyspraxia affects far more – influencing fine and gross motor skills, organisation, speech, and everyday functioning.</p><p>In a recent episode of the Neurodivergent Mates, we spoke with Jonathan Levy, Chair of the Dyspraxia Foundation in the UK, who opened up about his personal journey with dyspraxia, the realities of the condition, and how self-acceptance has shaped his career in leadership and advocacy.</p><p> This conversation sheds light on the real challenges – and surprising strengths – that come with living with dyspraxia, and what society needs to understand to foster true inclusion.</p><p><strong>Jonathan's Story: Early Diagnosis and Realising the Impact</strong></p><p>Jonathan was diagnosed with dyspraxia early in childhood, a blessing he attributes to growing up in a family of doctors who recognised the signs early. Despite early intervention, Jonathan grew up always knowing he was \"a bit different.\"</p><p> As a young adult, he volunteered in politics and was offered a job by a Member of Parliament (MP) in the UK. It was during this first professional role, at the age of 19, that Jonathan truly realised the significant impact dyspraxia had on his daily life.</p><p>Tasks that many might take for granted – like printing documents, stuffing envelopes, and signing letters – became hurdles. His struggles were not with the “intellectual” side of the job; he excelled at casework and policy discussions. But the practical, organisational tasks highlighted his dyspraxia daily.</p><p> Despite having disclosed his condition from day one, the lack of understanding from colleagues and his employer made the experience isolating and frustrating.</p><p><strong>Taking Action: Turning Frustration into Advocacy</strong></p><p>Jonathan's feelings of invisibility and misunderstanding in the workplace pushed him to act. During the UK's Dyspraxia Awareness Week, he wrote a heartfelt newspaper article about living and working with dyspraxia.</p><p> Initially, Jonathan hoped the article would prompt more understanding from his employer. Although it did not create change internally, the public reaction was overwhelming. Many resonated with his story, leading Jonathan to become a stronger advocate for dyspraxia awareness.</p><p>He later became a trustee and eventually the first Chair of the Dyspraxia Foundation to actually have dyspraxia himself – a major milestone in the charity's 35-year history.</p><p><strong>What is Dyspraxia? A Closer Look</strong></p><p>When educating others about dyspraxia, Jonathan explains it as affecting both <strong>fine motor skills</strong> (like writing and buttoning shirts) and <strong>gross motor skills</strong> (like balance and coordination).</p><p>Importantly, dyspraxia:</p><ul><li>Does not affect intelligence: It’s a processing difference, not a measure of capability.</li><li>Is lifelong: It doesn’t \"go away\" with age, though individuals may develop coping strategies.</li><li>Is highly individual: No two people experience it exactly the same way.</li></ul><p>Historically mislabelled as “Clumsy Child Syndrome,” awareness is still catching up to other conditions like autism or dyslexia. Society often underestimates the complexities dyspraxia brings — from difficulties with spatial awareness to organisational challenges to struggles with speech and social interaction.</p><p><strong>Beyond the Myths: Dyspraxia in Adulthood</strong></p><p>One of the most misunderstood aspects of dyspraxia is that many challenges persist into adulthood, albeit in different forms:</p><ul><li>Organisation and time management become critical hurdles.</li><li>Workplace demands around precision and multitasking may clash with executive function challenges.</li><li>Physical fatigue is common, as navigating tasks that require coordination or sustained attention is energy-draining.</li></ul><p>Jonathan shared that while he’s learned to navigate many challenges, the \"simple\" tasks often remain the hardest. For example, navigating directions, folding letters neatly, or mastering the timing of a multi-tasking work environment still require extra energy and focus.</p><p><strong>Dyspraxia and the Workplace: Breaking the One-Size-Fits-All Approach</strong></p><p>Jonathan’s experience highlights a broader systemic issue: workplaces are often not designed with neurodiversity in mind.</p><p>Despite modern discussions around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), many employers:</p><ul><li>Assume a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to work hours and task management.</li><li>Lack basic understanding of how neurodivergent brains operate differently.</li><li>Fail to create environments where flexibility and communication are prioritised.</li></ul><p>Jonathan stresses that small adaptations, such as flexible hours, written instructions, or an openness to alternative ways of completing tasks, can dramatically improve outcomes for dyspraxic employees.</p><p>Moreover, neurodivergent individuals often bring incredible strengths to teams: creativity, empathy, resilience, and the ability to think outside the box.</p><p><strong>Self-Acceptance: A Lifelong Journey</strong></p><p>One of the most powerful themes from Jonathan’s story is the importance of<strong> self-acceptance</strong>.</p><p>As a child and young adult, Jonathan often felt resentment about being “different.” Over time, through personal development, leadership training, and life experience, he embraced his dyspraxia not as a deficit but as part of his identity.</p><p>Key milestones in his journey toward self-acceptance included:</p><ul><li>Realising that his neurodivergence gave him unique leadership strengths, especially in empathy and listening.</li><li>Building a career in fundraising and politics where he could utilise his communication skills.</li><li>Learning that vulnerability and openness could be strengths rather than weaknesses.</li></ul><p>Self-acceptance doesn't mean pretending dyspraxia isn't challenging. It means recognising the challenges while also celebrating the successes that come from perseverance, resilience, and authenticity.</p><p><strong>Personal Development and Finding Your Own Lane</strong></p><p>Jonathan also emphasises the role of <strong>personal development</strong> in building confidence and leadership skills.</p><p>Early in his career, he absorbed lessons from business and leadership training, focusing on topics like resilience, strategic thinking, and goal setting. He encourages others, especially young neurodivergent individuals, to invest in their own personal development.</p><p>Key advice includes:</p><ul><li>Find mentors and role models (even if you have to become one yourself).</li><li>Focus on your goals, not comparisons with others.</li><li>Remember that leadership looks different for everyone – and neurodiverse leadership is a powerful asset.</li></ul><p>As Jonathan notes, leaders aren’t born; they’re made – often through lived experience, self-awareness, and a willingness to grow.</p><p><strong>Moving Forward: What Society Needs to Understand About Dyspraxia</strong></p><p>To build a more inclusive world for people with dyspraxia, Jonathan believes society must:</p><ul><li><strong>Recognise the hidden nature of many disabilities</strong>: Just because someone doesn’t \"look disabled\" doesn’t mean they don’t face daily challenges.</li><li><strong>Move beyond clumsiness stereotypes</strong>: Dyspraxia affects organisational skills, speech, memory, and emotional regulation too.</li><li><strong>Create flexibility in education and the workplace</strong>: Neurodivergent individuals thrive in environments that adapt to their strengths.</li><li><strong>Promote real leadership and representation</strong>: Seeing leaders who are open about their neurodivergence helps break down stigma and inspires others.</li></ul<p>Greater societal understanding of dyspraxia would not only benefit individuals with the condition, but would also create workplaces, communities, and systems that are stronger, more creative, and more inclusive overall.</p><strong>Conclusion: Leading with Courage and Compassion</strong></p><p>Jonathan’s journey is a testament to the power of resilience, self-acceptance, and advocacy. Living with dyspraxia presents unique challenges, but it also offers unique strengths — creativity, empathy, problem-solving, and authenticity.</p><p>As awareness grows, and more dyspraxic individuals step into leadership and advocacy roles, we edge closer to a world where difference is not just accepted, but valued.</p><p>In Jonathan’s own words: \"Everyone has a story worth sharing. And when we embrace our vulnerabilities, we unlock the power to create real change.\"</p><p><strong>Want to Connect?</strong></p><ul><li>Find Jonathan Levy on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jonathan Levy</a></li><li>Visit the Dyspraxia Foundation UK: <a href=\"dyspraxiafoundation.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dyspraxiafoundation.org.uk</a></li></ul>",

      "bodyText": "<p><strong>Introduction: Midlife, Neurodivergence, and Relationships — A Journey of Rediscovery</strong></p><p>Midlife is often described as a time of reflection, change, and transition. For neurodivergent adults — those with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and other cognitive differences — these changes can feel even more profound.</p><p>In this episode of the <strong>Neurodivergent Mates Podcast</strong>, we explore midlife, relationships, and neurodivergence with special guest <strong>Tamsin Jowett</strong>, a lawyer-turned-coach with lived experience navigating neurodivergent family life and relationships.</p><p>Tamsin’s story is one of resilience, rediscovery, and a commitment to empowering others. Together, we unpack the realities of midlife neurodivergent relationships, the emotional impact of late-diagnosed neurodivergence, and the need for new approaches to connection, communication, and compassion.</p><p><strong>The Early Years: Discovering Neurodivergence Through Family</strong></p><p>Tamsin’s journey into the neurodiversity world began not with her own diagnosis, but with her son’s.</p><p>While working in the corporate world abroad, her eldest son was diagnosed as autistic. This revelation opened the floodgates — leading to greater awareness not only about her son, but about her husband, her family, and ultimately herself.</p><p>As Tamsin explained, in the early 2000s, autism was often viewed through a negative, deficit-focused lens. Diagnosis often came with apologies rather than congratulations. Thankfully, times are changing — but back then, understanding was limited, stigma was high, and support was rare.</p><p>Rather than accepting outdated views, Tamsin became an advocate — volunteering for Aspergers Victoria, becoming its President, and later its CEO. Her work aimed to create safe spaces where neurodivergent people could belong, connect, and thrive.</p><p><strong>Midlife Unmasked: The Challenges of Transition</strong></p><p>As her children grew older and life circumstances changed, Tamsin began noticing how midlife transitions — children leaving home, career shifts, relationship evolution — uniquely impacted neurodivergent individuals.</p><p>Midlife often acts like a magnifying glass. Changes like hormonal shifts, menopause (and andropause for men), and evolving family roles reveal long-buried patterns, unmet needs, and hidden traumas. For many undiagnosed or late-diagnosed neurodivergent adults, midlife brings:</p><ul><li>Identity crises</li><li>Relationship strain</li><li>Heightened sensory sensitivities</li><li>Emotional burnout</li><li>A profound need for authenticity after years of masking</li></ul><p>Tamsin candidly shared that her own midlife journey involved the difficult process of divorce — a journey filled with grief, resilience, and self-discovery.</p><p><strong>The Realities of Midlife Neurodivergent Relationships</strong></p><p>One of the key messages from Tamsin’s story is that relationships are complex at midlife — and even more so when neurodivergence is involved. Key challenges include:</p><ol><li><strong>Communication Differences</strong><br>Neurodivergent individuals often process and express emotions differently. In a relationship, these differences can cause misunderstanding, frustration, and distance if not openly discussed.</li><li><strong>Sensory Overload and Emotional Burnout</strong><br>Midlife brings new stressors — career pressures, financial responsibilities, family changes. For neurodivergent people already prone to sensory overload, these stressors can easily tip into emotional burnout.</li><li><strong>Grieving the \"What Could Have Been\"</strong><br>Many neurodivergent adults in midlife experience a wave of grief — recognising how much easier life might have been with earlier understanding, accommodations, or diagnosis. Relationships are not immune to this grief.</li><li><strong>Rebuilding Identity</strong><br>Midlife often forces a redefinition of self. For neurodivergent individuals who spent decades masking, the desire to live authentically can create friction with long-standing relationship dynamics.</li></ol><p><strong>The Power of Self-Understanding</strong></p><p>According to Tamsin, one of the most vital steps toward healthier midlife relationships is <strong>deep self-understanding</strong>.</p><p> This includes:</p><ul><li>Recognising your sensory needs</li><li>Understanding your communication style</li><li>Identifying emotional triggers</li><li>Honouring your energy cycles</li><li>Learning your love languages</li></ul><p>Without this self-knowledge, it's easy to fall into cycles of people-pleasing, masking, resentment, and withdrawal — patterns that damage both individual wellbeing and relational health.</p><p><strong>The Importance of Authenticity in Relationships</strong></p><p>Authenticity is a core need for neurodivergent adults at midlife. After years of masking to fit neurotypical expectations, many reach a point where they can no longer — and no longer want to — hide who they are.</p><p>In relationships, this means:</p><ul><li><strong>Being upfront</strong> about needs, boundaries, and vulnerabilities</li><li><strong>Practicing clear communication</strong>, even when it's uncomfortable</li><li><strong>Accepting differences</strong> rather than trying to \"fix\" them</li><li><strong>Choosing partners and friends</strong> who celebrate authenticity rather than demand conformity</li></ul><p>Tamsin emphasised that relationships must be safe spaces where both individuals can show up fully, messily, and humanly — without fear of rejection.</p><p><strong>The Role of Midlife Coaching for Neurodivergent Adults</strong></p><p>Tamsin has transitioned her career toward coaching neurodivergent adults — especially those navigating midlife transitions.</p><p> Coaching offers:</p><ul><li><strong>A non-judgmental space</strong> to explore identity, values, and goals</li><li><strong>Practical strategies</strong> for improving communication, managing stress, and building resilience</li><li><strong>Tools for self-advocacy</strong>, both personally and professionally</li><li><strong>Support during divorce</strong>, career change, or re-entry into dating and relationships</li></ul><p>Midlife is not an ending — it’s a rebirth. Coaching helps neurodivergent individuals navigate this rebirth with clarity, courage, and compassion.</p><p><strong>Menopause, Andropause, and Neurodivergence: A Perfect Storm</strong></p><p>An important — and often overlooked — topic discussed was the impact of menopause (and andropause) on neurodivergent adults. </p><p>Hormonal changes in midlife can:</p><ul><li>Amplify sensory sensitivities</li><li>Increase anxiety and depression</li><li>Disrupt sleep and executive function</li><li>Heighten emotional reactivity</li></ul><p>For neurodivergent individuals already navigating complex internal worlds, these changes can feel destabilising.</p><p> Tamsin highlighted the urgent need for workplaces, healthcare providers, and society at large to better understand the intersection of menopause, andropause, and neurodivergence.</p><p><strong>Dating and Friendships at Midlife: New Norms, New Challenges</strong></p><p>Modern dating is hard enough — throw in neurodivergence and midlife transitions, and it gets even trickier.</p><p>Challenges include:</p><ul><li>Navigating sensory-unfriendly dating environments (noisy bars, crowded spaces)</li><li>Communicating needs and boundaries early without overwhelming potential partners</li><li>Managing vulnerability hangovers after opening up</li><li>Overcoming fears of rejection or misunderstanding</li></ul><p>However, there are upsides too:</p><ul><li>Clearer self-awareness leads to stronger relationship foundations</li><li>Seeking partners who value authenticity over perfection</li><li>Building deeper, more intentional friendships</li></ul><p>For many neurodivergent adults, <strong>friendships become just as vital — if not more so — than romantic relationships</strong> during midlife.</p><p><strong>Reimagining Relationships: A New Blueprint for Neurodivergent Midlife</strong></p><p>What if we approached relationships differently in midlife?</p><p>Instead of following outdated blueprints, Tamsin encourages neurodivergent adults to design relationships based on:</p><ul><li><strong>Mutual respect for neurodivergence</strong></li><li><strong>Shared curiosity and growth</strong></li><li><strong>Flexibility around roles and expectations</strong></li><li><strong>Prioritising emotional safety over traditional markers of success</strong></li></ul><p>Neurodivergent relationships may not always look like the movies — but they can be deeply fulfilling, creative, resilient, and authentic.</p><p><strong>Final Thoughts: Midlife Is a Beginning, Not an Ending</strong></p><p>Tamsin’s story is a powerful reminder: midlife is not a time of loss — it’s a time of rediscovery.</p><p>For neurodivergent adults, it offers a rare opportunity to finally embrace authenticity, build healthier relationships, and live with greater freedom and self-compassion.</p><p>Yes, there are challenges — grief, adjustment, vulnerability. But there is also immense potential for healing, connection, and joy.</p><p>As we better understand ourselves and each other, we create spaces where being different is not just accepted — it’s celebrated.</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p><strong>Introduction: The Cost of Late Diagnosis</strong></p><p>Navigating life undiagnosed as a neurodivergent individual is like travelling without a map. You know something is wrong, but you can’t quite explain it — and nobody around you can either. For Myke Ireland, this reality shaped his teens and early twenties, bringing a complex mix of confusion, frustration, creativity, and resilience.</p><p>In this special episode of the <strong>Neurodivergent Mates Podcast</strong>, we explore Myke’s story — from surviving school and early adulthood without a diagnosis, to eventually discovering he had ADHD and autism (AUDHD), and how that understanding transformed his life.</p><p><strong>Growing Up Without a Map: Life Before Diagnosis</strong></p><p>Myke’s childhood and adolescence were marked by a constant sense that something was different. Yet without the language or diagnosis to explain it, every challenge felt personal — as if he was simply \"failing\" at life.</p><p>As a kid, Myke was often labelled the \"class clown\" — highly intelligent but disruptive. The traditional school structure, requiring students to sit still for long periods after finishing tasks quickly, felt like torture. Predictably, teachers misunderstood his behaviour as laziness or defiance rather than recognising his neurodivergence.</p><p>Social struggles also surfaced early. Myke struggled to form and maintain friendships, often feeling like he was “missing the manual” on how relationships were supposed to work.</p><p>Yet throughout it all, he developed a strong sense of empathy, humour, and self-reliance — skills that would later become critical strengths.</p><p><strong>Escaping Through Reinvention: The Power and Pitfall of Masking</strong></p><p>A defining feature of Myke’s early years was his tendency to \"reinvent\" himself every time he changed schools or social environments.</p><p>Instead of being accepted for who he was, Myke learned to <strong>mask</strong> — modifying his behaviour and personality to fit in, to be liked, and to avoid rejection. While masking provided short-term social survival, it came at a long-term cost: chronic anxiety, people-pleasing, and a shaky sense of identity.</p><p>Looking back, Myke now understands this was his undiagnosed ADHD and autism at work — constantly seeking external validation and struggling with executive function challenges without even realising it.</p><p><strong>The Transition to Adulthood: Freedom Without Foundations</strong></p><p>Adulthood brought newfound freedom — but without the structure of school, things quickly spiraled.</p><p>Entering the social world of nightclubs, university bars, and parties, Myke faced intense sensory overload. The crowds, lights, and noise were overwhelming — until alcohol and later recreational drugs offered a dangerous \"solution\" to numb the discomfort.</p><p>Like many undiagnosed neurodivergent adults, Myke used substances not to party, but to <strong>self-medicate</strong> — finding temporary relief from social anxiety, executive dysfunction, and emotional overwhelm.</p><p>As his twenties progressed, the lack of understanding about his brain's wiring led to increased struggles with:</p><ul><li>Emotional regulation</li><li>Career direction</li><li>Relationship stability</li><li>Mental health challenges</li></ul><p>All of it fed by an invisible current: undiagnosed neurodivergence.</p><p><strong>Finding the Missing Puzzle Pieces: Diagnosis in Adulthood</strong></p><p>Myke’s diagnosis journey was catalysed by a conversation with a friend who casually mentioned they were neurodivergent.</p><p>Curious — and initially sceptical — Myke began researching neurodivergence and immediately felt seen. Terms like <strong>Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria (RSD)</strong> jumped off the screen, describing emotional reactions he had struggled with for years.</p><p>Eventually, Myke pursued formal diagnosis through a GP and specialists, uncovering both ADHD and autism. While both diagnoses were validating, it was the <strong>autism diagnosis</strong> that truly resonated — explaining lifelong patterns of sensory sensitivity, social difficulty, and a need for structure.</p><p>Receiving the diagnoses was a revelation. For the first time, Myke understood that he wasn’t broken — he was neurodivergent.</p><p><strong>The Rollercoaster of Self-Acceptance</strong></p><p>Diagnosis doesn’t automatically bring self-acceptance.</p><p>Initially, Myke fell into the common trap of thinking, \"Now that I know, I can fix myself and be normal.\" Over time, he realised that real healing meant <strong>accepting himself as he is</strong>, not trying to \"cure\" his neurodivergence.</p><p>This journey involved:</p><ul><li><strong>Unlearning decades of negative self-talk</strong>: Recognising the harsh inner critic that constantly called him lazy, broken, or not good enough.</li><li><strong>Redefining success</strong>: Moving away from traditional markers of success and focusing on personal growth and authenticity.</li><li><strong>Building a support system</strong>: Working with a psychologist, ADHD coach, and finding community among other neurodivergent individuals.</li></ul><p><strong>The Workplace: The Importance of Neurodivergent-Inclusive Cultures</strong></p><p>Throughout his career in technology and audiovisual industries, Myke faced typical neurodivergent workplace challenges:</p><ul><li>Expectations to conform to rigid norms (like wearing suits instead of prioritising comfort)</li><li>Misunderstandings about communication and work style</li><li>Emotional burnout from masking</li></ul><p>However, A major turning point came when he joined a company with a strong culture of inclusivity. For the first time, Myke felt supported when disclosing his challenges — and rather than penalising him, the company embraced his authenticity.</p><p>This supportive environment allowed Myke to not only thrive professionally but also personally, catalysing his advocacy for greater neurodivergent representation in the workplace.</p><p><strong>Self-Medication and Substance Use: The Dark Side of Coping</strong></p><p>For many undiagnosed neurodivergent individuals, substances like alcohol and drugs become coping mechanisms.</p><p>In Myke’s case, Stimulants like ecstasy initially seemed to \"normalise\" his mind — helping him think clearly and connect socially in ways he struggled to do sober.</p><p>Yet, over time, substance use brought its own problems: dependence, health consequences, and emotional crashes.</p><p>One of Myke’s major post-diagnosis realisations is how often neurodivergent adults are mislabelled as addicts or troublemakers when they are, in fact, desperately <strong>self-medicating neurological differences</strong>.</p><p><strong>How Music Became a Lifeline</strong></p><p>Throughout his struggles, <strong> music</strong> served as a powerful coping tool.</p><p>From early obsessions with video games and Star Wars figurines, to a deep love for alternative and metal music, Myke found stability and emotional expression through passions.</p><p>In adulthood, music continued to offer solace — not just as a DJ and audio professional, but as a personal escape, a focus point, and a sensory regulation tool.</p><p>Music’s structured rhythms, emotional intensity, and predictable patterns aligned perfectly with his neurodivergent brain’s needs.</p><p><strong>Positive Traits: The Superpowers Hidden in Plain Sight</strong></p><p>Despite the challenges, being neurodivergent also brought many strengths to Myke’s life:</p><ul><li><strong>Hyperfocus</strong>: An ability to immerse himself deeply in areas of passion, like technology and music production.</li><li><strong>Creativity</strong>: Thinking differently, connecting dots others missed.</li><li><strong>Empathy</strong>: A deep emotional intuition that fuels leadership and advocacy work.</li><li><strong>Resilience</strong>: Years of navigating misunderstandings built a thick skin and a determination to make the world better for others.</li></ul><p><strong>Advocating for Others: Turning Pain Into Purpose</strong></p><p>Today, Myke channels his experiences into advocacy.</p><p>Through his podcast Real Insight, LinkedIn presence, and daily conversations, he helps others feel seen and understood — especially those still struggling without a diagnosis.</p><p>He believes that true inclusion starts with open conversations, honest vulnerability, and leadership by example. His goal? To make workplaces, education systems, and social environments genuinely welcoming for neurodivergent individuals.</p><p>As he says:<br>“Everyone has a story worth sharing. And when we embrace our vulnerabilities, we unlock the power to create real change.”</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Healing by Being Your Authentic Self</strong></p><p>Myke’s story is a powerful reminder that self-acceptance is a journey, not a destination.</p><p>Living undiagnosed caused immense pain and confusion. But understanding his neurodivergence allowed him to reframe his struggles — not as personal failures, but as natural consequences of a world not designed for brains like his.</p><p>Today, he stands as proof that embracing who you are — fully and unapologetically — can turn struggle into strength, and pain into purpose.</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p>In this episode of the Neurodivergent Mates Podcast, we dive deep into the story of Tom O'Connor, a talented tradesman and artist from Brisbane navigating the workforce as an autistic adult. Tom's journey is a powerful reminder that neurodivergent individuals can not only thrive but truly excel in trades and creative industries. Here, we explore his path, the challenges he faced, and the lessons he shares for others.</p><p><strong>Embracing a Hands-On Career</strong></p><p>From an early age, Tom found traditional schooling difficult. Like many autistic students, he struggled with essay-based assessments and large classroom environments. However, he discovered he excelled in hands-on subjects like science and workshop classes. This realisation led him to pursue a trade, where he completed an apprenticeship in cabinet making and shopfitting.</p><p>Tom's career has evolved into working at Urban Art Projects, where he now contributes to large-scale public art installations, including Indigenous art panels and sculptures. His move into metal casting and mould-making was unexpected but highlights how flexibility and on-the-job learning can open exciting new doors for autistic professionals.</p><p><strong>The Impact of Late Diagnosis</strong></p><p>Tom received his autism diagnosis at 26 after years of being misdiagnosed with depression and anxiety. For Tom, the diagnosis was life-changing. He realised that much of his \"anxiety\" was actually sensory overload and that \"depression\" often stemmed from autistic burnout.</p><p>Understanding his neurodivergence allowed Tom to manage sensory issues and energy levels better, helping him build a sustainable work life. His story is a common one, with many autistic adults not receiving proper diagnosis or support until adulthood. Tom's experience stresses the importance of seeking answers and advocating for oneself.</p><p><strong>Thriving in Trades with Autism</strong></p><p>The trades environment, often considered rough and ready, was surprisingly welcoming for Tom. He credits his success to his sense of humour and his ability to blend into workplace culture. Although trades historically had a macho reputation, Tom notes that attitudes toward neurodiversity and mental health have significantly improved.</p><p>In his current role, Tom's colleagues and supervisors value his contributions without viewing his autism as a liability. He believes that demonstrating competence and openly communicating with coworkers can foster a supportive environment for neurodivergent individuals in trades.</p><p><strong>Managing Sensory Overload</strong></p><p>Sensory overload is a daily reality for Tom, whether in crowded pubs, live music venues, or public transport. He shares strategies like wearing noise-cancelling headphones, taking breaks, and being self-aware about his limits.</p><p>Tom emphasises that managing sensory overload is key to maintaining mental wellbeing. He also highlights that sensory challenges are not failures—they are part of being neurodivergent and need to be recognised and accommodated.</p><p><strong>Building Connection Through Neurodiversity</strong></p><p>One of the most heartwarming parts of Tom's story is his discovery of a community. Once he began opening up about being autistic, he found that many friends and colleagues also identified as neurodivergent. This shared experience built deeper connections and a strong support network.</p><p>Neurodivergent people often naturally gravitate toward one another, creating communities where understanding, empathy, and acceptance flourish. Tom’s experience reflects the growing neurodiversity movement that values differences rather than viewing them as deficits.</p><p><strong>The Challenges of Misdiagnosis</strong></p><p>Tom's story also sheds light on how neurodivergent traits are often misunderstood. He discusses how he used alcohol in social settings to mask sensory overwhelm and anxiety—a coping strategy that, while common, can be harmful.</p><p>He also points out that misdiagnosing autism as depression or anxiety often delays the right support and intervention. Greater awareness among medical professionals and society at large is critical to reducing these misdiagnoses and ensuring neurodivergent individuals receive the care they need.</p><p><strong>Advice for Young Neurodivergent Adults</strong></p><p>Tom offers invaluable advice for young people navigating the transition into adulthood:</p><ul><li><strong>Embrace who you are:</strong> Autism is not a defect. Your differences can be strengths.</li><li><strong>Pursue your passions:</strong> Find work that suits your learning style and interests.</li><li><strong>Be open where you feel safe:</strong> Talking about your neurodivergence can build strong support networks.</li><li><strong>Recognise burnout:</strong> Learn the early signs and prioritise self-care.</li><li><strong>Find your community:</strong> Connecting with other neurodivergent individuals can provide immense emotional support.</li></ul><p>By following these principles, young neurodivergent adults can build careers and lives that celebrate their true selves.</p><p><strong>Shifting Workplace Culture</strong></p><p>Tom’s workplace experience shows that workplaces are slowly but surely becoming more inclusive. Mental health and neurodiversity conversations are happening more openly, especially among younger workers. Trades, often seen as rigid environments, are evolving to become more supportive spaces where skills and character are valued over conformity.</p><p>Tom highlights the importance of positive leadership—supervisors and coworkers who understand and accommodate different needs create workplaces where everyone can thrive.</p><p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p><p>Tom O'Connor’s story is a powerful example of what’s possible when neurodivergent individuals find environments that support their strengths. Working a trade with autism is not just possible—it can be fulfilling, creative, and transformative.</p><p>At Neurodivergent Mates Podcast, we believe stories like Tom's are vital for changing perceptions and inspiring others. Neurodivergent individuals bring unique talents to every field. By embracing difference, creating inclusive spaces, and fostering community, we can build a future where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.</p><p>To hear the full conversation, check out Episode 16 of the Neurodivergent Mates Podcast, available now on Spotify and major platforms.</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p>By Will Wheeler – Neurodivergent Mates Podcast</p><h2>Introduction: A Family Conversation</h2><p>Neurodiversity is often spoken about in research, workplaces, or classrooms — but what about inside families? Behind every neurodivergent child, there are parents navigating the unknown, making mistakes, and building resilience along the way.</p><p>In a very special episode of Neurodivergent Mates, I sat down with my mum, Marilyn Wheeler, to reflect on our family’s journey. From raising two neurodivergent sons to later realising her own ADHD traits, Mum’s perspective offers invaluable lessons about love, persistence, and parenting when there’s no rule book.</p><h2>Our Neurodivergent Family Story</h2><p>Marilyn begins by describing our family as “normal” — but with hindsight, it’s clear neurodiversity runs through every branch.</p><ul><li>My dad, Bill, is dyslexic, though undiagnosed in childhood when teachers dismissed him as “a bit of a dummy.”</li><li>I was diagnosed with dyslexia at age eight and later with ADHD, classified as twice-exceptional (2E).</li><li>My brother Craig was diagnosed early with both dyslexia and dyspraxia, requiring years of therapy for motor skills.</li><li>And eventually, Mum herself recognised the hallmarks of ADHD in her own life.</li></ul><p><em>“I don’t intend to be diagnosed. I’ve developed strategies over the years to cope. But I definitely am ADHD.” – Marilyn</em></p><p>This realisation reframed our family story: not one of deficit, but of resilience and adaptability.</p><h2>Parenting Without a Map</h2><p>Looking back, Mum says the hardest part of parenting neurodivergent kids in the 80s and 90s was not knowing. At that time, ADHD was narrowly associated with “naughty boys” who couldn’t sit still. Dyslexia was only beginning to be recognised in Australia.</p><p>That left parents like Mum and Dad without clear guidance. Instead, they faced judgement from teachers, confusion from professionals, and their own fears about “doing something wrong.”</p><p><em>“I’d take you to playgroup, and you’d cling to me. I’d think: I must be the worst parent on earth. Who knew about ADHD back then?” – Marilyn</em></p><h2>School Struggles and Teacher Battles</h2><p>The transition from preschool to school was particularly hard. Where early childhood was filled with creativity and play, primary school demanded conformity, sitting still, and endless worksheets.</p><p>As a child, I often pushed back — sometimes telling teachers exactly what I thought of their authority. While that landed me in trouble, Mum also recalls the good teachers who saw my potential, encouraged my creativity, and made a lifelong impact.</p><p>Still, she often found herself at school advocating with little effect. Every year she would hand over psychologist reports, explain my dyslexia, and stress that I was bright. But instead of tailored support, I was often punished with detentions or kept in at lunch — strategies that only made things worse.</p><h2>The Cost of Professional Advice</h2><p>Like many parents, Mum and Dad spent thousands of dollars chasing solutions.</p><ul><li><strong>Tutors:</strong> Exhausting late-night sessions that left me disengaged.</li><li><strong>Educational programs:</strong> Expensive software that gathered dust after a few weeks.</li><li><strong>Glasses:</strong> Prescribed by a professional despite my eyesight being perfectly fine.</li></ul><p><em>“We thought we were doing the right thing. We weren’t professionals — we just wanted to help our son.” – Marilyn</em></p><p>It was a reminder that not all “expert advice” is right for every child, and that parents must be cautious of quick-fix promises.</p><h2>Building Resilience Through Hard Work</h2><p>One thing that did help was work. Our family ran a commercial cleaning business, and from age 14 my brother and I were employed alongside adult staff.</p><p>The rules were clear: we had to work harder than anyone else. That experience built resilience, independence, and financial literacy. We learned to budget, save for cars, and respect the value of money.</p><p>At the same time, sport became a lifeline. With Mum and Dad coaching and managing teams, my brother and I thrived on the field even when school was difficult. Sport gave us confidence and a sense of belonging that academics often couldn’t.</p><h2>Teenage Years: A Wild Ride</h2><p>When asked about my teenage years, Mum doesn’t sugar-coat it:</p><p><em>“Your teenage years were an absolute disaster.” – Marilyn</em></p><p>From 14 into my early twenties, I made plenty of poor choices. Like many neurodivergent teens, I masked, sought acceptance from the “cool kids,” and sometimes ended up in risky situations.</p><p>Yet these years were also about testing boundaries, building independence, and eventually realising that I needed to take responsibility.</p><p>Travelling overseas became a turning point. Away from family safety nets, I had to grow up quickly, manage my own life, and eventually discover a love for learning that school never nurtured.</p><h2>Strategies That Worked</h2><p>Mum reflects that the most effective parenting strategies weren’t complicated programs but simple consistency and presence:</p><ul><li><strong>Being involved:</strong> Whether it was sport, school meetings, or work, Mum and Dad were always around.</li><li><strong>Encouraging strengths:</strong> Focusing on what we could do, not just where we struggled.</li><li><strong>Setting expectations:</strong> Teaching accountability through hard work in the family business.</li><li><strong>Role modelling:</strong> Demonstrating empathy, kindness, and resilience in daily life.</li></ul><p><em>“You can’t go around saying, ‘poor us.’ You just live your life the best way you can and support your kids to do the same.” – Marilyn</em></p><h2>Shifting Into Adulthood</h2><p>As both Craig and I entered adulthood, Mum says the challenges shifted but the core lesson remained: sometimes parents must let go.</p><p>When I moved overseas, my parents were terrified but supportive. That separation forced both my brother and me to step up in different ways. For me, it became the seed for building Neurodiversity Academy years later. For Craig, it meant becoming more independent and confident in his own right.</p><h2>What Still Needs to Change</h2><p>When asked what changes she’d like to see in schools, communities, and workplaces, Mum didn’t hesitate:</p><ul><li><strong>Earlier, affordable testing</strong> – Too many families wait years or spend thousands to access assessments.</li><li><strong>Less stigma</strong> – Community attitudes still equate neurodivergence with disability or failure.</li><li><strong>Workplace inclusion beyond policies</strong> – Tick-box diversity statements don’t change culture. True inclusion requires action, empathy, and seeing strengths.</li></ul><p>Her message is clear: neurodiversity needs to be understood as difference, not deficit.</p><h2>Advice for Parents</h2><p>Finally, I asked Mum what advice she’d give parents just starting their journey raising a neurodivergent child. Her response was simple but powerful:</p><p><em>“Accept, love, love, love your kids. Don’t let teachers or report cards define them. Find what they’re good at and encourage it. Just support them no matter what.” – Marilyn</em></p><p>It’s advice rooted not in theory but in lived experience — a reminder that resilience is built on unconditional love.</p><h2>Conclusion: Wired Differently, Loved the Same</h2><p>This conversation with my mum reminded me that parenting through neurodiversity is messy, emotional, and often filled with doubt. But it’s also where resilience is forged.</p><p>Our family story isn’t about “overcoming” neurodivergence — it’s about recognising it, embracing it, and building lives that reflect our strengths. For parents starting this journey, the road may feel uncertain. But as Mum shows, love, persistence, and belief in your children make all the difference.</p><h2>Where to Find More</h2><p>Catch the full conversation with Marilyn Wheeler, by clicking the link below.</p>",

      "imageUrl": "",
      "description": "Dr Natasha Arthars explores how tertiary education can better support students with ADHD. From executive functioning challenges to rethinking accommodations, discover strategies to build confidence, inclusion, and long-term success.",
      "header": "Rethinking ADHD Support in Tertiary Education",
      "bodyText": "<p>By Will Wheeler – Neurodivergent Mates Podcast</p><h2>Introduction: Why University Isn’t Always Built for Everyone</h2><p>Higher education is often framed as the natural next step after high school. For many, it represents independence, growth, and career opportunities. But for students with ADHD, the transition from the structure of school to the self-directed nature of tertiary education can be overwhelming.</p><p>In a recent episode of Neurodivergent Mates, I spoke with Dr Natasha Arthars, researcher, educator, and valued member of the Neurodiversity Academy Advisory Board, about how universities can better support students with ADHD. Her story and research highlight the challenges, gaps, and opportunities for rethinking how tertiary education is designed.</p><h2>Natasha’s Path to Academia</h2><p>Natasha’s journey into higher education wasn’t straightforward. Today, she holds multiple vocational and university qualifications, has taught across VET and higher education, and completed a PhD in 2021. But before that success, she had two failed attempts at university.</p><p>On her third try, she found her stride and eventually discovered a passion for research. Her experiences now inform her work: focusing on adult learners, student engagement, and how technology – including AI – can improve educational outcomes.</p><h2>Growing Up Undiagnosed</h2><p>Like many neurodivergent people, Natasha wasn’t diagnosed in school. Her report cards followed a familiar pattern: high performance in primary school, followed by struggles in high school. Teachers said she could “do really well if only she applied herself.”</p><p>She describes herself as easily bored, full of anxious energy, and often in conflict with teachers. Maths class was a particular flashpoint – she found it too easy, became disruptive, and was regularly kicked out.</p><p><em>“I wasn’t the class clown, but I was bored. I’d finish quickly, distract others, and get thrown out. Looking back, it all makes sense now.” – Natasha</em></p><p>She also carried a strong sense of justice – challenging teachers when she felt they weren’t treating students fairly. This tendency, common among ADHD and autistic individuals, created further conflict but also foreshadowed her later advocacy for students’ voices.</p><h2>Executive Functioning and Brain Development</h2><p>To understand why ADHD presents unique challenges in tertiary education, Natasha explains executive functioning: the brain’s control system, located in the prefrontal cortex. It governs planning, working memory, impulse control, and cognitive flexibility.</p><p>For students with ADHD:</p><ul><li>Planning is difficult due to time-blindness.</li><li>Working memory overloads quickly, leading to shutdown.</li><li>Impulse control lags behind peers.</li><li>Cognitive flexibility can be rigid, making it harder to adapt to change.</li></ul><p>Research shows that the prefrontal cortex typically matures by the early twenties. But for those with ADHD, development can be delayed by 2–5 years. This means neurotypical students may manage independent study and deadlines in their early twenties, while ADHD students are still grappling with executive functioning skills.</p><h2>The Challenge of Transitioning to University</h2><p>High school provides structure: fixed timetables, daily routines, and teachers chasing students up on work. University, by contrast, expects self-directed learning. Students must plan study schedules, track deadlines, and navigate variable timetables.</p><p>For students with ADHD, this shift is jarring. Common struggles include:</p><ul><li>Difficulty initiating assignments.</li><li>Trouble tracking multiple deadlines.</li><li>Overloaded working memory.</li><li>Poor impulse control when balancing study with social opportunities.</li></ul><p>These challenges often result in procrastination, missed deadlines, and increased stress.</p><h2>When Accommodations Miss the Mark</h2><p>Most universities offer similar accommodations for ADHD students:</p><ul><li>Extra time for assignments.</li><li>Additional exam time.</li><li>Quiet rooms or rest breaks during tests.</li></ul><p>While helpful in theory, Natasha questions their real impact. Many students report that extensions simply shift deadlines without solving underlying issues.</p><p>One student in a recent Australian study explained:</p><p><em>“If I get a week’s extension, that just becomes my new due date. It doesn’t actually help me manage the workload.”</em></p><p>This creates a domino effect: assignments are pushed back into exam periods or holidays, leaving students perpetually behind. Research shows little evidence that extra time specifically benefits ADHD students compared to neurotypical peers.</p><p>Natasha argues that what students need is not just assessment accommodations but learning accommodations: structured support, templates, scaffolding, and proactive check-ins.</p><h2>Learning Access: Making Classes More ADHD-Friendly</h2><p>Natasha believes universities must move beyond “time-based” accommodations to rethink learning access.</p><p>Practical changes include:</p><ul><li>Recorded lectures: Allowing students to replay at their own pace, speed up content, or rewatch explanations.</li><li>Pre-released materials: Enabling students to preview content, prepare questions, and reduce cognitive overload in live classes.</li><li>Camera choice in online learning: Forcing cameras on can create unnecessary anxiety; giving students control respects neurodiverse needs.</li><li>Structured choice: Providing clear assignment templates, examples, and scaffolds prevents overwhelm.</li></ul><p>Will added that recorded lectures would have helped him immensely – by allowing him to process material beforehand, then attend class prepared with questions, and later review explanations again.</p><h2>Building Confidence Through Early Support</h2><p>Both Natasha and I agreed that early intervention is critical. Instead of throwing students “into the lion’s den,” support structures should begin at the start of university:</p><ul><li>Scheduled check-ins with staff.</li><li>Guidance on executive functioning skills.</li><li>Building routines around planning, organisation, and prioritisation.</li></ul><p>Confidence is a key outcome. As Natasha notes, once students feel capable, they need less support and begin to self-manage. Success builds momentum: mastering Word, PowerPoint, or referencing skills, for example, empowers students to keep going.</p><p><em>“Confidence and self-efficacy shape identity. If students leave tertiary education believing they’re failures, it impacts their careers and lives long-term.” – Natasha</em></p><h2>The Flow-On Effect to the Workplace</h2><p>Supporting students with ADHD isn’t just about education – it has direct implications for the workplace. University graduates carry their study habits, confidence, and self-beliefs into employment.</p><p>If tertiary education builds confidence and executive functioning skills, graduates are better prepared for professional environments. If it undermines them, the cycle of underemployment and self-doubt continues.</p><h2>Rethinking Support: From Accommodations to Inclusion</h2><p>Ultimately, Natasha argues that universities need to shift from narrow accommodations to inclusive design. This means:</p><ul><li>Viewing flexibility as essential, not optional.</li><li>Designing assessments and learning environments that work for all students.</li><li>Embedding executive functioning supports into study programs.</li></ul><p>As student numbers grow and neurodiversity becomes more visible, institutions that fail to adapt will not only disadvantage students but also risk losing relevance in a competitive sector.</p><h2>Conclusion: Time to Rethink the Model</h2><p>Dr Natasha Arthars’s insights highlight the urgent need to rethink ADHD support in tertiary education. Extra time alone won’t close the gap. Instead, universities must focus on confidence, inclusion, and executive functioning supports that empower students to thrive.</p><p>Her message is clear:</p><p><em>“Education should be designed to support all students, not just those who fit the traditional mould.”</em></p><p>By rethinking accommodations, embedding inclusive practices, and listening to student voices, tertiary education can become a place where neurodivergent learners don’t just survive – they succeed.</p><h2>Where to Find Natasha</h2><p>Connect with her on LinkedIn or find her academic work on Google Scholar.</p><h2>Listen to the Full Episode</h2><p>Catch the full conversation with Dr Natasha Arthars, by clicking on the link below.</p>",
