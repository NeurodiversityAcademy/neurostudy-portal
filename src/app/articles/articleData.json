      "bodyText": "<h3>Not Enough Ness and Neurodivergence</h3><p><strong>By Kara Lambert</strong></p><p>In my daily life, I help business owners overcome Imposter Syndrome. Never heard of it? It’s the deep-seated feeling that we don’t measure up to some invisible standard we imagine others — a boss, a client, a peer — expect from us. It’s a belief that we are somehow not enough. This feeling of \"not enoughness\" sits at the heart of Imposter Syndrome and is more common than we think.</p><p>In the other aspect of my life, I’m a mother to two adult neurodivergent children, and I am also neurodivergent. All three of us are gifted, which is one form of neurodivergence. We also share experiences with anxiety — another common neurodivergent experience.</p><p>One of my children has an IQ above 150. The other? They didn’t complete the test due to dysgraphia, a learning difference that affects writing. I sit at 130. But in our household, intelligence isn’t a competition. We know and accept our abilities. That said, one child went to university and the other chose a trade. There is no judgment between them. Yet the one who pursued a trade sometimes feels \"not enough\" — not because of us, but because of messages from school and society that imply university is the only path to success.</p><p>The child with chronic health issues is a deep thinker. They research, connect with online communities, and seek out stories from others with the same condition. But even here, comparison creeps in. They sometimes wonder if they’re \"sick enough\" to belong.</p><p>This feeling of not enoughness isn’t limited to my children. I often feel it when I look at conversations about neurodivergence. I see discussions about masking, sensory overwhelm, school trauma, and lack of support — and I see myself in those stories. I’ve experienced them, and I’ve supported my children through them. I’ve helped them through meltdowns, left events early due to overstimulation, and held space during crises. Yet at times, I don’t feel neurodivergent \"enough.\"</p><p>Growing up, I taught my kids a simple truth: when someone makes you feel small, remember who you are. You know your truth. You know your values. You know what drives your behaviour. But this wisdom often arrives after the harm. After the comment. After the glance. After the spiral.</p><h3>The Spiral of Not Enoughness</h3><p>Let’s break that down. Sometimes, our feelings of not enoughness are triggered by what someone says. Often, it’s someone we admire or who holds authority. In that moment, two things can happen. One: we recall the facts and stand firm in our truth. Or two: we miss the moment, and the comment lodges itself in our memory, reinforcing an old narrative of not being enough. Over time, our brains — specifically the reticular activating system — begin scanning for more evidence to support that narrative.</p><p>But here’s the thing: most of the time, it’s not others saying we’re not enough. It’s us. Our thoughts spiral. We hyperfixate. We compare. We tell ourselves we’re not doing enough, achieving enough, being enough. We scroll through social media, watch others speak on neurodivergence or success, and our brains collect evidence to support the story we already believe.</p><h3>A Reminder to Anchor Yourself</h3><p>So I want to offer you a reminder:</p><p><strong>Remember your truth.</strong></p><p>When a moment or comment causes that wave of not enoughness, pause. Ask yourself: what are the facts? What do I know to be true about myself? How do I experience the world? How do I show up for myself and others?</p><p>Your feelings are valid. Your neurodivergence is valid. Your experience is yours to define. No one else can determine whether you are \"enough.\"</p><p><strong>You are.</strong></p><h3>Connect with Kara</h3><p>If you want to dive deeper into Imposter Syndrome or learn tools to help manage these feelings, you can explore more here:</p><ul><li><strong>Kara's Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://karalambert.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">karalambert.com</a></li><li><strong>YouTube:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@karalambertcom\"target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@karalambertcom</a></li><li><strong>Instagram:</strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/karalambertcom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> @karalambertcom</a></li><li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karalambertcom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Kara Lambert </a></li></ul>",

      "bodyText": "<h3>The Hidden Curriculum: What Neurodivergent Employees Wish We Knew</h3><p><strong>By Kathleen McCarthy</strong>, creator of hey!dhd — an Autistic ADHD’er navigating the working and learning world, advocating for inclusion, clarity, and authenticity in learning and workspaces.</p><p>When we talk about what it takes to succeed in the workplace, the focus usually lands on the obvious stuff: showing up on time, being good at your job, communicating clearly, and playing well with others.</p><p>But lurking just beneath these formal expectations is something harder to pin down — a set of unwritten, unspoken rules that shape how we’re seen, included, and promoted at work. This is the hidden curriculum. And for many of us autistic people, it’s one of the biggest challenges to feeling safe, supported, and successful in the workplace.</p><p>Here at hey!dhd, the hidden curriculum is something we work hard to undo in the way we go about our own work. We also partner with neurodivergent individuals and organisations to demystify these unspoken systems. This is especially critical for neurodivergent students as they prepare to leave school and embark on life beyond it. So, let’s take a look at how the hidden curriculum shows up and how it impacts us — and what we can do about it.</p><h3>What Is the Hidden Curriculum?</h3><p>The hidden curriculum is all the informal, assumed, and often invisible knowledge that shapes how things really work at work. These aren’t written into job descriptions or onboarding documents, but they’re still enforced — often through social consequences or missed opportunities.</p><p>Think of things like:</p><ul><li>Knowing when to speak up in meetings (and when to hold back)</li><li>Navigating office politics and social hierarchies</li><li>Understanding how much small talk is “just enough”</li><li>Realising who has influence — regardless of their title</li></ul><p>For neurotypical employees, these expectations are often absorbed unconsciously. Often, I feel like the rules were presented at a meeting I forgot to attend — or sent in a memo I accidentally deleted before I read it. For autistic employees, decoding these signals requires active effort, mental energy, and a lot of guesswork — and even then, it’s easy to get it wrong.</p><h3>How the Hidden Curriculum Impacts Neurodivergent Employees</h3><h4>1. Misreading and Mis-responding</h4><p>For many neurodivergent people, interpreting implied instructions or reading between the lines is a nightmare. One of my most common faux pas when I worked in corporate came after the classic, \"Does anyone have any last questions before I close the meeting?\" I always had a question.</p><p>And it’s not that I didn’t “understand” humour — I just didn’t find jokes about gender or sarcastic discrimination funny (even way back in the 1990s).  It’s not the words that are misinterpreted, but how we engage with the (unwritten but expected) appropriate response to them. That difference can lead to awkward moments or social missteps, which are often unfairly interpreted as rudeness, disengagement, or unprofessionalism.</p><h4>2. Social Exhaustion</h4><p>For many autistic workers, navigating these unspoken rules requires masking — a constant effort to blend in, follow social norms, and suppress natural behaviours. But masking is exhausting. And I could never pull it off. One of my go-to masks while working in finance was pretending to be interested in the NSW rugby league. As the office hyped up for State of Origin, I joined the conversation with: \"So, who’s playing?\" I can still feel the disdain from the group. Over time, masking can lead to burnout, shutdowns, and a deep sense of disconnection — not to mention embarrassment.</p><h4>3. Unclear Expectations</h4><p>When crucial workplace expectations are left unsaid — like the importance of informal networking or like how “visibility” is tied to promotion — neurodivergent employees can be left in the dark. Missing these cues isn’t about capability. It’s about access.</p><p>ADHD-me still loves Friday night drinks, but Autistic-me struggles with the social small talk. And at this time of year, what’s everyone chatting about? The NRL and the school tipping comp. Torture.</p><h3>What We Can Do as Neurodivergent Employees</h3><p>It shouldn’t be our job to decode a secret system just to survive (cue Mission Impossible music). But until workplace norms shift more widely, here are a few ways we can advocate for ourselves — and some signs to look for when choosing (or staying in) a workplace.</p><h4>1. Ask Questions — and Notice the Response</h4><p>If something feels unclear or unspoken, ask for clarification. The reaction you get is telling. Inclusive teams won’t make you feel silly for asking — they’ll thank you for helping bring clarity to the group.</p><h4>2. Look for Signals of Neuro-Inclusivity</h4><p>Signs of a genuinely inclusive workplaces might include:</p><ul><li>Clear, structured onboarding processes</li><li>Flexible or asynchronous communication options</li><li>Managers who ask, “What support works best for you?”</li><li>Openness to written communication over impromptu meetings</li><li>A culture where feedback flows in both directions</li></ul><h4>3. Unmask Selectively</h4><p>Masking can be a survival strategy — but it’s okay to take it off sometimes. Finding even one person or space where you don’t have to pretend is invaluable. If there’s no such space? That’s information, too.</p><p>Many of my students and clients have asked me whether they should unmask at work. That moment always feels like one of those fixed points in a time travel movie — significant and deeply personal. I feel so privileged to hold space for those questions. Only you can decide when and how to unmask, and that’s why these conversations are so important. It’s not just about self-advocacy — it’s about understanding when unmasking may not be in your best interest.</p><h4>4. Name the Hidden Curriculum</h4><p>Sometimes the most powerful thing we can do is name it. Saying, \"There seems to be an expectation here that hasn’t been named\" or \"I just want to check if there’s an unwritten rule I’m missing\" brings the invisible into the open. It can prompt others to reflect on the systems in place. That said, it’s a big call — and one I still find terrifying at times.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>The hidden curriculum isn’t just a neurodivergent issue — it’s a barrier to inclusion for anyone who doesn’t neatly match normative expectations. By naming it, questioning it, and refusing to blame ourselves for not predicting what was never said out loud, we begin to shift the culture.</p><p>Because we know that clarity helps everyone. And when we share our stories and start conversations about the impact of the hidden curriculum, we begin to see it for what it is: a systemic issue — not a personal failing rooted in a neurodivergent person’s \"deficits.\"</p><p>At hey!dhd, we create space for this connection and conversation — through mentoring, post-school support, and workplace cultural change.

      "bodyText": "<h3>From Education to Employment: Creating Neuro-Inclusive Pathways</h3><p>For many neurodivergent individuals, the journey from school or university to the workplace is filled with barriers. These barriers are often not a result of lack of skills or ambition but rather due to systemic gaps in understanding, support, and inclusion. As society becomes more aware of the benefits of embracing cognitive diversity, it’s time to ask: how can we create smoother, more empowering transitions for neurodivergent people moving from education to employment?</p><p>In this article, we explore what inclusive transitions look like, the role of educators and employers, and the importance of building bridges—not just ticking boxes.</p><h3>The Transition Gap: Where Systems Fall Short</h3><p>The education system and the employment system are often disconnected when it comes to neurodiversity. Students may receive supports such as accommodations, learning plans, or allied health interventions while in school, but once they graduate, these supports can disappear overnight.</p><p>This “support cliff” leaves many neurodivergent young people struggling to adjust to the demands of job hunting, workplace norms, or even understanding what types of roles might align with their strengths. Without clear, inclusive pathways, capable individuals fall through the cracks—despite being ready and willing to contribute.</p><h3>Barriers in Recruitment and Hiring</h3><p>One of the first obstacles neurodivergent jobseekers face is the traditional recruitment process.</p><p>Common issues include:</p><ul><li>Job advertisements that use vague or jargon-heavy language.</li><li>Application forms that are inflexible or inaccessible.</li><li>Interview processes that favour verbal fluency, eye contact, and social charm.</li><li>Assessments that rely on multitasking or fast recall under pressure.</li><li>Office environments that are often intolerable for high-sensory people, such as LED lighting, loud and/or distracting noises, closed spaces, too many people or hurdles to get to meeting rooms and potential waiting times in a similar environment.</li></ul><p>These practices are not inherently malicious—but they are exclusionary. They test for neurotypical behaviours, not job-relevant skills.</p><p>For example, an autistic applicant might excel in software development but struggle to make small talk in an interview. A person with ADHD might thrive in fast-paced environments but find it hard to complete lengthy written applications. Without inclusive hiring, organisations miss out on extraordinary talent.</p><h3>What Inclusive Hiring Looks Like</h3><p>Inclusive hiring doesn’t require lowering standards. It requires widening the lens of what competence and potential look like. Best practices include:</p><ul><li>Clear, straightforward job descriptions with specific expectations.</li><li>Alternative application methods (e.g., video submissions, practical tasks).</li><li>Sending interview questions in advance.</li><li>Replacing interviews with trial shifts or project-based assessments.</li><li>Ensuring accessibility in digital platforms and physical spaces.</li></ul><p>Some employers, like IBM and Ernst & Young, have created neurodiversity-focused recruitment programs. These initiatives have proven not only inclusive but highly effective in attracting loyal, innovative employees.</p><h3>Preparing Neurodivergent Students for the Workplace</h3><p>While employers must change their practices, education systems also have a role to play in preparing students for neuro-inclusive work environments. This includes:</p><ul><li>Teaching self-advocacy skills (e.g., how to ask for accommodations).</li><li>Building executive functioning through real-world tasks.</li><li>Offering work experience placements tailored to neurodivergent strengths.</li><li>Providing career counselling that understands cognitive diversity.</li></ul><p>Universities and TAFEs should partner with employers who understand inclusion and who are willing to support diverse learners during internships, placements, and apprenticeships.</p><h3>The Role of Career Services</h3><p>Career services in educational institutions are often underutilised by neurodivergent students—partly due to lack of awareness, and partly due to lack of trust. These services can become more inclusive by:</p><ul><li>Providing quiet, sensory-friendly environments.</li><li>Offering resources in multiple formats (visual, video, audio).</li><li>Training staff on neurodiversity and communication styles.</li><li>Connecting students with mentors who are also neurodivergent.</li></ul><p>When students feel seen and supported, they are more likely to engage and take proactive steps toward employment.</p><h3>Designing Inclusive Onboarding</h3><p>Getting the job is only the beginning. Onboarding is a critical phase where neurodivergent employees either feel welcomed and equipped—or overwhelmed and disconnected.</p><p>Inclusive onboarding includes:</p><ul><li>Clear schedules for the first week, explained in advance.</li><li>Step-by-step introductions to tasks and systems. Multimodal approaches provide additional reinforcement, that is a combination of modelling and written instructions.</li><li>Time to process and ask questions without pressure.</li><li>Collaborative opportunities, completing tasks within a group environment.</li><li>Opportunities to shadow peers or receive hands-on demonstrations.</li><li>Troubleshooting guidance—combined with proactive check-ins by mentors.</li><li>Consistency is critical in early stages.</li></ul><p>Visual guides, recorded tutorials, and regular check-ins can make a huge difference in building confidence and trust.</p><h3>Workplace Supports that Make a Difference</h3><p>Accommodations don’t have to be expensive or complicated. Common supports that benefit neurodivergent employees include:</p><ul><li>Flexible hours or remote work options.</li><li>Noise-cancelling headphones or quiet workspaces.</li><li>Clear agendas, issued prior to meetings. Follow-ups for non-RSVPs. Written follow-ups after meetings and opportunities to clarify understanding.</li><li>Task management tools like Kanban-Trello (good for task management), Notion (sense-making for project management progress to clear outcomes), or visual calendars (time management and routine).</li><li>Mentoring programs that offer guidance and social connection—consistency reduces anxiety and improves efficiency.</li></ul><p>Most of these supports benefit all staff—not just neurodivergent team members. They create environments where people feel empowered to work in ways that align with their strengths.</p><h3>Cultivating Inclusive Cultures</h3><p>One-off accommodations are not enough. Inclusion must be embedded into the culture of the workplace. This involves:</p><ul><li>Leadership commitment to neurodiversity.</li><li>Company-wide training on inclusive communication and unconscious bias.</li><li>Celebrating neurodivergent role models and success stories.</li><li>Creating employee resource groups for neurodivergent staff.</li><li>Reducing barriers to opportunity for self- and job promotion.</li></ul><p>When organisations value different ways of thinking, problem-solving, and contributing, they become more innovative, resilient, and attractive to top talent.</p><h3>The Importance of Mentorship</h3><p>Mentorship is particularly valuable during career transitions. Neurodivergent individuals benefit from guidance not just on job tasks, but on navigating workplace norms, self-advocacy, and career planning.</p><p>Where possible, pair neurodivergent employees with mentors who understand their lived experience. This could be a peer, a manager, or an external coach. What matters is trust, respect, and a willingness to learn together.</p><h3>Bridging the Gap with Policy and Advocacy</h3><p>Systemic change requires more than good intentions. It requires policy. Governments, educational institutions, and industry bodies can contribute by:</p><ul><li>Funding inclusive internship and employment programs.</li><li>Requiring accessibility audits for education-to-employment initiatives.</li><li>Incentivising inclusive hiring through grants or recognition programs.</li><li>Creating guidelines for neuro-inclusive onboarding and workplace design.</li></ul><p>Advocacy organisations play a vital role in pushing for these changes and amplifying the voices of neurodivergent people in the process.</p><h3>Empowering Neurodivergent Jobseekers</h3><p>Ultimately, the goal is not just to “place” neurodivergent individuals into jobs—it’s to empower them to pursue meaningful careers on their own terms. This includes:</p><ul><li>Helping them identify their strengths and values.</li><li>Supporting them to build networks and portfolios.</li><li>Encouraging them to explore entrepreneurship or self-employment.</li><li>Validating their right to take up space, be accommodated, and thrive.</li></ul><p>Empowerment is not about fixing people. It’s about fixing systems.</p><h3>Conclusion: A Path Worth Building</h3><p>The journey from education to employment is a pivotal stage in life. For neurodivergent individuals, this transition is often filled with untapped potential. With inclusive hiring, supportive education, and proactive workplace design, we can bridge the gap and ensure all minds have the opportunity to shine.</p><p>This isn’t just about compliance—it’s about building workplaces and communities that reflect the true diversity of human thought.</p><p>The future of work is inclusive. Let’s create pathways that welcome everyone to walk forward with dignity and purpose.<p>Author Acknowledgement: Based on the original work by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leanne-gaul-5438b2151/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leanne Gaul</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "<h3>Lifting the Mask: Understanding the Impact of Masking on Neurodivergent Individuals</h3><p>For many neurodivergent people, surviving in a world built for neurotypical norms often requires a complex, exhausting practice: masking. Masking involves suppressing or hiding one’s natural behaviours in order to appear more socially acceptable. This might mean mimicking eye contact, scripting conversations, forcing smiles, or copying tone and gestures.</p><p>While masking may help individuals avoid judgment or exclusion in the short term, it can come at a significant emotional and psychological cost. In this article, we explore what masking is, why it happens, and how we can create spaces where authenticity is welcomed and supported.</p><h3>What is Masking?</h3><p>Masking is a form of social camouflage. It is most commonly discussed in the context of autism but can apply to people with ADHD, anxiety, or other neurodivergent conditions. For example, someone with ADHD might try to sit still for long periods or refrain from interrupting, even though their brain is urging them to move or speak.</p><p>Masking is often learned early. Many neurodivergent children receive clear social messages—through peers, teachers, or media—that their natural behaviours are “wrong” or “weird.” To cope, they adapt by hiding their differences.</p><h3>Why Do People Mask?</h3><p>People mask for many reasons:</p><ul><li>To fit in socially </li><li>To avoid bullying or exclusion </li><li>To succeed at school or work </li><li>To protect themselves from misunderstanding or discrimination </li></ul><p>Sometimes, masking becomes so habitual that individuals don’t realise they’re doing it. They may only notice its effects—fatigue, anxiety, or disconnection from their identity.</p><h3>The Psychological Cost</h3><p>Masking can lead to “autistic burnout” or emotional exhaustion caused by the constant pressure to conform. This burnout isn’t the result of overwork in a traditional sense but of sustained self-suppression. It can present as depression, shutdowns, physical illness, or loss of functioning.</p><p>Long-term masking has also been linked to:</p><ul><li>Anxiety and panic disorders </li><li>Depression and suicidal ideation </li><li>Identity confusion and dissociation </li><li>Delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis </li></ul><p>When someone spends years pretending to be someone else, it’s no surprise that their mental health suffers.</p><h3>The Gendered Nature of Masking</h3><p>Research suggests that women and non-binary people are more likely to mask than men—possibly contributing to underdiagnosis in these groups. Girls, in particular, may be socialised to “blend in,” making it harder for teachers and clinicians to recognise neurodivergence.</p><p>This is why more adults are receiving diagnoses later in life—often after years of burnout or misdiagnosed mental health conditions. Understanding masking helps professionals better identify and support diverse presentations of neurodivergence.</p><h3>Masking in Schools and Workplaces</h3><p>Educational and professional settings can unintentionally reinforce masking. Rules that require “good eye contact,” penalise stimming (repetitive movements), or demand constant participation favour neurotypical behaviours.</p><p>Reinforcement of reward systems for neurotypical students are exacerbated by non-inclusive K-12 syllabus frameworks, which set rigid assessment subjects and criteria performance which do not align with neurodivergent capabilities. Nor are these frameworks designed for flexibility to build on their strengths for academic success and improved self-worth. Often masking or absenteeism is used to cover these perceived inadequacies.</p><p>In the workplace, expectations around socialising, multitasking, or adapting quickly can pressure employees to hide their needs. When disclosure feels unsafe, masking becomes a survival tool.</p><p>Unfortunately, the cost is often disengagement, high turnover, or hidden distress.</p><h3>Creating Spaces Where Masking Isn’t Necessary</h3><p>The best way to support neurodivergent people is to build environments where they don’t feel they need to mask in the first place. This includes:</p><ul><li>Normalising different ways of communicating </li><li>Allowing stimming or movement, and sensory toys or devices in class or meetings – this must be individually led if possible </li><li>Offering written instead of verbal participation </li><li>Multimodal communications – as needed on a case by case basis </li><li>Encouraging disclosure and protecting privacy </li><li>Listening without judgment to both questions for clarification or contributions </li></ul><p>When people are accepted as they are, they begin to feel safe enough to drop the mask. That’s when real learning, collaboration, and creativity can begin.</p><h3>The Power of Authenticity</h3><p>Authenticity is not just beneficial for neurodivergent individuals—it’s healthy for everyone. When people feel they can bring their whole selves to a space, they engage more deeply, think more freely, and build stronger relationships.</p><p>Unmasking is a journey, not a moment. It takes time, trust, and often community support. For many neurodivergent individuals, the first time they meet someone like themselves is a transformative experience. It validates their identity and gives them permission to be fully human.</p><h3>Supporting the Unmasking Process</h3><p>If you’re a parent, educator, or manager, you can support unmasking by:</p><ul><li>Asking how someone prefers to communicate or work </li><li>Avoiding assumptions about behaviour </li><li>Offering options rather than enforcing uniformity </li><li>Being patient when someone begins to express themselves more openly </li></ul><p>And if you’re neurodivergent yourself, know that masking does not mean you’re inauthentic. It means you’ve adapted in order to survive. That in itself is a powerful strength—but you deserve to thrive, not just survive.</p><p>Masking is a deeply ingrained and often invisible part of many neurodivergent lives. It reflects the pressure to conform in environments that don’t yet understand or accommodate difference. But change is possible—and it begins with awareness, acceptance, and action.</p><p>By lifting the mask, we create space for people to live more freely, fully, and authentically. Let’s build schools, workplaces, and communities where everyone can show up as themselves—and know they are enough.</p><p>Author Acknowledgement: Based on the original work by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leanne-gaul-5438b2151/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leanne Gaul</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "<h3>Supporting Neurodivergent Teens at Home: Practical Strategies for Caregivers</h3><p>Parenting a teenager is rarely straightforward, but supporting a neurodivergent teen adds an extra layer of complexity, beauty, and resilience to the journey. Neurodivergent teens may be autistic, have ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, Tourette’s, or a combination of these and other cognitive differences. Each young person’s experience is unique—and as a caregiver, understanding and supporting that individuality can make all the difference.</p><p>This article explores practical, empathetic, and flexible strategies to help families build safe, connected, and empowering environments for their neurodivergent teenagers.</p><h3>Understanding Neurodivergent Teenagers</h3><p>Neurodivergent teens often experience the world differently from their neurotypical peers. Their sensory systems, executive functioning, communication styles, and learning preferences can lead them to feel misunderstood or out of sync with school expectations, social norms, and even family routines.</p><p>It’s essential for caregivers to remember that neurodivergence is not a deficit—it’s a different way of being. When support is grounded in respect and curiosity, rather than attempts to “fix,” teens are more likely to feel safe, validated, and capable.</p><h3>Creating a Safe Space at Home</h3><p>Home should be a sanctuary. For neurodivergent teens who may mask all day at school—suppressing their stimming, scripting conversations, or trying to follow confusing social rules—home must offer a place where they can drop the mask and just be themselves.</p><p>Start by setting expectations around mutual respect. This might include:</p><ul><li>Not forcing eye contact.</li><li>Respecting and facilitating sensory preferences (e.g., dim lights, quiet zones).</li><li>Allowing for downtime after school before engaging in chores or conversations.</li><li>Providing emotional validation before problem-solving.</li><li>Allow them to choose the time to approach a discussion over any personal issues. However, don’t make the mistake of allowing too much time to pass. Take a sundowner approach – try to resolve before bedtime.</li><li>Allow them to lead on advocacy, outlining the next steps to be made.</li><li>In situations where there is more than one neurodivergent teen, setting ground rules for mutual respect of individual needs.</li></ul><p>Let them know that being different is not only accepted—it’s valued.</p><h3>Establishing Consistent (But Flexible) Routines</h3><p>Many neurodivergent teens thrive with predictable routines. A consistent morning or evening schedule can reduce anxiety and help manage transitions. However, too much rigidity can be stressful—especially when teens are exploring independence.</p><p>Strategies for balanced routines include:</p><ul><li>Using visual planners, calendar apps or whiteboards. Sharing calendars for booking appointments is critical for planning around school obligations, particularly senior school.</li><li>Collaborating with your teen to build the schedule.</li><li>Leaving “buffer time” between activities. Try to make appointments in school holidays if possible, particularly for medical or ancillary services assessments.</li><li>Reviewing the schedule together at the start and end of each day. Shared calendars may only require a check-in every few days to make sure everything is on track.</li></ul><p>Adjust routines as needed, based on feedback and observation. Flexibility within structure empowers teens to develop time management skills while accommodating their fluctuating energy and focus.</p><h3>Supporting Executive Functioning Challenges</h3><p>Executive functioning skills—like planning, organising, remembering, and transitioning—are often a challenge for neurodivergent teens. Rather than labelling this as laziness or defiance, try to understand what support looks like for your child.</p><p>Support might involve:</p><ul><li>Breaking large tasks into smaller, manageable steps.</li><li>Creating to-do lists together.</li><li>Using timers for activities or breaks. Incentives and rewards are also important.</li><li>Gently coaching your teen(s) through sequences like getting ready for school. Prompts or reminders are essential here.</li><li>Additionally, take steps the night before to organise as much as possible, uniforms and school bags in particular.</li></ul><p>Be patient. These skills take time to develop and will grow with consistent, compassionate support.</p><h3>Communicating Effectively</h3><p>Neurodivergent teens may communicate in ways that differ from neurotypical norms. Some may use fewer words, prefer written over verbal communication, or find it hard to express emotions. Others may speak rapidly or focus on specific interests intensely.</p><p>To build open communication:</p><ul><li>Use clear, literal language.</li><li>Avoid sarcasm or idioms unless they’re understood.</li><li>Respect the need for processing time—don’t pressure immediate answers.</li><li>Check in using tools like mood thermometers, colour charts, or messaging apps.</li><li>Use your detective skills, you often know when something is wrong. Teens don’t like to communicate at the best of times, so proactive check-ins are sometimes needed.</li><li>If you have a counsellor or psychologist, you may use this as an opportunity for a three-way connection. As a carer, you can open up discussions on topics you may think are an issue. Be patient with this process, it may take time to build trust with your teen. Start with minor things and build on these successes.</li></ul><p>Above all, listen more than you speak. Teens want to be heard, not managed.</p><h3>Encouraging Emotional Regulation</h3><p>Emotional outbursts or shutdowns are not signs of a “bad attitude.” They’re often signals that a teen is overwhelmed, anxious, or misinterpreting social or sensory input. Helping your teen learn emotional regulation doesn’t mean punishing meltdowns—it means supporting recovery and prevention.</p><p>Strategies include:</p><ul><li>Creating a calming routine (e.g., weighted blankets, music, quiet time).</li><li>Teaching emotional vocabulary through books or visual aids.</li><li>Offering “break passes” for when emotions become too intense.</li><li>Self-regulation can help teens to recognize signs of stress and request actions to circumvent impacts. Create awareness by discussing these signs.</li><li>Modelling your own regulation strategies.</li></ul><p>Regulation is learned through connection, not correction.</p><h3>Working with Allied Health Professionals</h3><p>Occupational therapists (OTs), psychologists, speech pathologists, and paediatricians can offer valuable insights and tools. Regular check-ins with professionals who understand neurodiversity can:</p><ul><li>Validate your strategies at home.</li><li>Offer new techniques for communication or learning.</li><li>Help teens build coping skills and resilience.</li><li>Support diagnosis or adjustment plans for school or exams.</li></ul><p>It’s important to work with professionals who take a strengths-based, affirming approach—not those who see neurodivergence as something to “treat away.”</p><h3>Navigating School and Advocacy</h3><p>Many neurodivergent teens struggle in mainstream schools due to inflexible teaching styles, sensory overload, or misunderstanding. Caregivers are often the bridge between home and school—and that role can be both empowering and exhausting.</p><p>Helpful actions include:</p><ul><li>Keeping records of communication and incidents.</li><li>Collaborating on Individual Learning Plans (ILPs).</li><li>Advocating for adjustments like reduced homework, breaks, or alternative assessments.</li><li>Often letters or support or recommendations from allied health professionals can help to support your requests.</li><li>Connecting with local advocacy groups or support networks.</li></ul><p>Encourage your teen to share their school experiences and involve them in planning their supports. This builds confidence and models self-advocacy.</p><h3>Celebrating Strengths and Interests</h3><p>Neurodivergent teens often have deep, passionate interests—whether it’s video games, trains, drawing, coding, or animals. These interests are not distractions; they are gateways to learning, expression, and confidence.</p><p>Celebrate and support these interests by:</p><ul><li>Creating time and space for them.</li><li>Linking interests to learning goals.</li><li>Encouraging clubs, online communities, or shared projects.</li><li>Seeing them as part of your teen’s identity and future.</li></ul><p>When teens feel competent and seen in their interests, their sense of self-worth grows.</p><h3>The Power of Humour and Connection</h3><p>Humour is a powerful tool in any household. It diffuses tension, creates shared memories, and reminds everyone that joy matters. Embrace silliness. Celebrate quirky routines. Laugh together—not at each other.</p><p>Connection doesn’t always look like deep talks or hugs. Sometimes it’s watching a favourite show together, sending memes, or sitting silently in the same room. Let your teen lead in how they want to connect.</p><h3>Preparing for Adulthood</h3><p>As your teen grows, the goal isn’t independence at all costs—it’s interdependence. Help them gradually build life skills like:</p><ul><li>Cooking simple meals.</li><li>Managing money with guidance.</li><li>Navigating transport or digital tools.</li><li>Booking appointments or asking for help.</li></ul><p>Work with your teen to develop a vision for their future, exploring education, work, or supported living options that align with their needs and strengths.</p><h3>Conclusion: You Are Not Alone</h3><p>Supporting a neurodivergent teen is a journey filled with learning, patience, mistakes, and growth—for both the teen and their caregivers. There is no perfect roadmap, but there are values that guide the way: empathy, flexibility, trust, and joy.</p><p>Caregivers who approach this journey with curiosity and compassion provide their teens with the most important gift of all: a foundation of love that honours exactly who they are.</p><p>You are not alone—and neither is your teen.</p><p>Author Acknowledgement: Based on the original work by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leanne-gaul-5438b2151/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leanne Gaul</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "<h3>Teaching Neurodivergent University Students: A Flexible and Inclusive Approach</h3><p>As higher education evolves to meet the needs of a more diverse student body, one group is increasingly stepping into the spotlight: neurodivergent students. These are learners who may be autistic, have ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, Tourette syndrome, or other cognitive differences. Neurodivergence isn't a deficit — it’s a variation in how brains function and process information. Yet, many university systems remain built around neurotypical norms.</p><p>This article explores how lecturers, tutors, and university staff can create more flexible, accessible, and inclusive learning environments that support neurodivergent students to thrive—not just survive.</p><h3>Understanding the Neurodivergent Student Experience</h3><p>Neurodivergent students often face challenges that are invisible to others: sensory sensitivities in lecture halls, difficulties with executive functioning, or anxiety around social interaction and group work. They may also face stigma or past educational trauma, especially if their needs were un-met or misunderstood in high school.</p><p>At the same time, these students bring unique strengths: attention to detail, deep interest in specific topics, creative problem-solving, and lateral thinking. Acknowledging both their needs and their abilities is key to inclusive education.</p><h3>The Power of Universal Design for Learning (UDL)</h3><p>Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a framework that anticipates the variability of learners and designs curriculum, assessment, and environments from the outset to be accessible to all. Instead of retrofitting adjustments, UDL asks: how can we build flexibility into learning for everyone?</p><p>UDL strategies in higher education may include:</p><ul><li>Creating safe learning environments through setting clear and accepted norms.</li><li>Providing multiple means of engagement (e.g., flexible attendance policies, varied participation methods).</li><li>Offering multiple means of representation (e.g., video lectures, transcripts, visual aids).</li><li>Allowing multiple means of expression (e.g., presentations, essays, media projects).</li><li>Rewarding participation (e.g. graded responses varying from basic to insightful answers).</li><li>Educator-student check-ins and feedback.</li><li>Creating opportunities to build communities and a sense of belonging through communications platforms.</li></ul><p>UDL doesn’t just benefit neurodivergent students—it makes learning better for everyone.</p><h3>Structuring Flexible Learning Environments</h3><p>Lecturers can make small but impactful changes to create more inclusive classes:</p><ul><li>Begin each session with an outline or visual agenda.</li><li>Clearly state learning outcomes and expectations.</li><li>Create opportunities for multi-modal questions (written or verbal), both formally (educator instigated) and informally (student instigated).</li><li>Use accessible fonts and colour-contrast slides.</li><li>Offer downloadable materials before class.</li><li>Model exemplar best practice solutions through student-led responses in real time, iteratively improving subject matter knowledge through educator insights.</li><li>Record lectures, provide summaries or solutions for review.</li></ul><p>Flexibility doesn’t mean lowering standards. It means creating options that allow more students to meet those standards in ways that align with their learning styles.</p><h3>Rethinking Participation</h3><p>Many neurodivergent students struggle with traditional models of classroom participation. Speaking out in large groups, responding quickly, or engaging in spontaneous debate may not be inclusive of all learners.</p><p>Instead, offer varied ways to participate:</p><ul><li>Online discussion boards or polls.</li><li>Group chats or collaborative docs.</li><li>Small-group discussions or breakout rooms.</li><li>Reflective journals or written feedback.</li></ul><p>It really comes down to flexibility and choice of communications and participation. By broadening what “engagement” looks like, educators may give students multiple ways to show their understanding and build confidence.</p><h3>Supporting Executive Functioning</h3><p>University demands a high level of organisation, time management, and task planning—all areas where neurodivergent students may need support.</p><p>Strategies for supporting executive functioning include:</p><ul><li>Breaking assignments into stages with checkpoints – progressive assessments give student’s opportunities to gain a deeper understanding of the subject scenario with respect changing subject matter. This reduces the level of variation.</li><li>Choose a time, such as the beginning or end of class, to have student best practice sessions to discuss methods of improving study outcomes. For example; how using visual timelines or planners can help achieve better time management and academic outcomes.</li><li>Unmasking mental health and well-being problems, providing clarity over the signs that can indicate support is needed and where to find it.</li><li>Offering assignment templates or checklists and clear rules over what are acceptable actions and what are not. A simple set of multiple-choice questions can help here, which must be completed prior to accessing the assessment resources.</li><li>Providing learning subject matter broken into a series of organized tabulated content. Long passages of information can be daunting to neurodivergent learners, breaking this down may make it more manageable.</li><li>Encouraging peer accountability or study groups, even providing advice or assistance in setting these up.</li></ul><p>Where possible, include time during class to begin projects, so students can clarify expectations and ask questions.</p><h3>Building Safe Spaces for Disclosure</h3><p>Some students choose to disclose a diagnosis or learning difference to their educators. Others do not, often due to fear of stigma, past negative experiences, or lack of clarity on how their information will be used.</p><p>Educators can support disclosure by:</p><ul><li>Including inclusive statements in course outlines and introductory lectures or tutorials.</li><li>Explaining the role of accessibility services and how to access them.</li><li>Reassuring students that adjustments are common and welcomed.</li><li>Offering private check-ins or optional feedback forms.</li></ul><p>Whether a student discloses or not, it’s best practice to assume variability in your class and teach accordingly.</p><h3>Collaborating with Accessibility Services</h3><p>Universities typically have disability support teams that help coordinate learning plans for students with diverse needs. Academic staff can support this work by:</p><ul><li>Responding promptly to accommodations.</li><li>Implementing recommendations without drawing attention to the student.</li><li>Asking for clarification if unsure about a strategy.</li><li>Advocating for systemic improvements within faculties.</li></ul><p>Working together, educators and support staff can ensure neurodivergent students receive consistent, respectful, and timely support.</p><h3>Inclusive Assessment Practices</h3><p>Standardised exams and rigid essay formats can disadvantage students who think and communicate differently. Inclusive assessment includes:</p><ul><li>Providing alternative formats for assignments and exams.</li><li>Offering extensions without penalties when needed.</li><li>Sharing clear marking rubrics and assessment criteria upfront.</li><li>Making assessment outlines and resources more accessible – providing summarised information in subject outlines with links to online content; particularly in cases of content heavy subjects.</li><li>Avoid lengthy passages or statements and complex wording.</li><li>Use diagrams and tables where possible.</li><li>Allowing creative or multimodal responses (e.g., video, podcast, portfolio).</li></ul><p>Encouraging students to demonstrate knowledge in ways that play to their strengths can reveal deeper learning and insight.</p><h3>Addressing Sensory and Social Challenges</h3><p>University environments can be overstimulating. Noisy labs, crowded lecture halls, and harsh lighting can create barriers for neurodivergent students. Strategies for improving sensory inclusion include:</p><ul><li>Offering lecture replays for students who need breaks.</li><li>Reserving quiet spaces or alternative exam rooms.</li><li>Letting students choose where to sit or work.</li><li>Using softer lighting or digital formats.</li><li>Providing student mentors as additional options for troubleshooting issues. This is a program related option as leadership positions must be trained in steps to resolving or referring students.</li></ul><p>Social dynamics can also pose challenges. Group work should be structured and guided with clear roles, timelines, and communication expectations. Insights into group mechanics can also provide opportunities for student-led role selection and defining each participants’ required contributions and objectives. This provides clarity for neurodivergent learners, thus reducing or avoiding anxiety.</p><h3>Educator Self-Reflection and Growth</h3><p>Being an inclusive educator means being open to reflection. Ask yourself:</p><ul><li>Who participates most in my class? Who is silent?</li><li>Are my materials accessible and varied? Should I be accessing in-house educational design services?</li><li>Have I assumed neurotypical behaviours as the “norm”?</li><li>How do I respond to unexpected behaviours or requests?</li></ul><p>Continual learning and openness to feedback build more inclusive classrooms over time.</p><h3>Highlighting Neurodivergent Role Models</h3><p>Representation matters. Where possible, include neurodivergent voices in readings, guest lectures, or case studies. Celebrate the achievements of scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, and thinkers who are neurodivergent.</p><p>This helps students feel seen and valued—not just supported.</p><h3>Conclusion: Inclusion is Innovation</h3><p>Teaching neurodivergent university students isn’t just an act of accommodation—it’s an opportunity to innovate. Inclusive classrooms prepare all students for diverse workplaces, communities, and collaborations.</p><p>By embracing flexibility, empathy, and evidence-based strategies, educators can build learning spaces that honour the full spectrum of human cognition.</p><p>Neurodivergent students belong in our lecture halls, labs, and leadership programs. Let’s make sure our systems are ready for them—not the other way around.</p><p>Author Acknowledgement: Based on the original work by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leanne-gaul-5438b2151/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leanne Gaul</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "<h3>Empowering the Transition: How AI Can Support Neurodivergent Teens Through Tertiary Education</h3><p><strong>By Will Wheeler – Neurodiversity Academy</strong></p><p>The journey from high school to tertiary education can be daunting for any teenager—but for neurodivergent teens, the challenges are amplified. Executive functioning, time management, emotional regulation, and organization become even more critical during this transitional phase.</p><p>That’s why we launched our first webinar, <i>Empower Their Transition: AI Support for Neurodivergent Teens</i>, featuring renowned educator and advocate <strong>Craig Smith</strong>. Craig brought his wisdom, experience, and a toolkit of AI resources designed to support neurodivergent learners in navigating their next steps.</p><h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>As someone who left school without clear direction—told I’d never have a proper career—I know firsthand how discouraging early setbacks can be. Neurodiversity Academy was born from that experience. Our goal is simple but powerful: help neurodivergent students find supportive, inclusive educational environments and equip them with tools to thrive.</p><p>This webinar wasn’t just about cool tech. It was about <strong>transforming lives through understanding and innovation</strong>.</p><h3>Meet Craig Smith: Educator, Advocate, Innovator</h3><p>Craig Smith is a global leader in inclusive education. He’s the Manager of Technology and Innovation at Positive Partnerships (Autism Spectrum Australia), a consultant to Apple on accessibility, and a lecturer at Notre Dame University. His work has reached the UN, global ministries of education, and classrooms across the world.</p><p>But what really sets Craig apart is his <strong>human-centred, playful approach</strong> to education. In this session, he showed us just how powerful that can be when paired with the right tech.</p><h3>The Power of AI for Executive Functioning</h3><p>Craig walked us through five key executive functioning areas that AI can support:</p><p><strong>1. Planning and Organisation</strong></p><p>AI tools like <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, <strong>Goblin Tools</strong>, and <strong>Ayoa</strong> can break down complex tasks into manageable steps. For example, ChatGPT can act as your “assignment breakdown coach,” dissecting a lengthy assessment into a sequenced, timed checklist. Goblin Tools even allows visual tick-box planning—perfect for neurodivergent learners who thrive on structure.</p><p><strong>2. Time Management</strong></p><p>Using prompts like “Create a weekly study schedule with time for cooking, exercise, and rest,” AI can generate personalized timetables. Craig demonstrated this using ChatGPT and apps like <strong>Teemo</strong>, which visually map out routines.</p><p><strong>3. Working Memory</strong></p><p>AI tools such as <strong>Otter</strong> (for lecture transcription) and <strong>Notebook LM</strong> (for organizing and querying study notes) support memory retention. These tools give students a second brain to help with review, repetition, and comprehension.</p><p><strong>4. Metacognition</strong></p><p>To get “unstuck,” AI can offer motivational role-playing prompts—like turning study sessions into secret agent missions. This turns executive dysfunction into an engaging, gamified experience, increasing emotional investment and follow-through.</p><p><strong>5. Emotional Regulation</strong></p><p>Craig introduced his own <strong>AI-powered Spoon Theory Calculator</strong>, which helps users visualize energy use across tasks and prevent burnout—a vital support in managing mental wellness during transitions.</p><h3>Voice Mode: A Game-Changer</h3><p>One of Craig’s favourite features? The <strong>voice chat mode in ChatGPT</strong>. This allows users to talk through their plans and problems and receive interactive, real-time guidance—ideal for students who think better out loud or struggle with written prompts.</p><p>It’s even being used creatively—like one teen who used ChatGPT in “Harry Potter mode” to guide her through cleaning her room!</p><h3>Practical Considerations: Safety, Ethics, and Access</h3><p>Many attendees raised questions about <strong>privacy, ethics, and readiness</strong>. Craig and I agree—students must be taught to use these tools safely, ethically, and effectively. That means:</p><ul><li>Avoiding personal data input</li><li>Using AI as a guide, not a replacement</li><li>Understanding accessibility vs. academic integrity</li><li>Learning how to self-manage and prioritize with digital tools</li></ul><h3>The Bigger Picture: Changing the System</h3><p>There’s no one-size-fits-all path to education. And yet, too often our systems treat neurodivergent students as if there is. Through Neurodiversity Academy, we aim to:</p><ul><li>Build a national directory of <strong>neuro-inclusive education providers</strong></li><li>Host <strong>regular free webinars</strong> with lived-experience experts</li><li>Deliver <strong>community-driven education resources</strong></li><li>Equip neurodivergent individuals with skills for <strong>both study and life</strong></li><li>Our upcoming platform will function much like Open Universities Australia—but with a neurodivergent lens</li></ul><p>If you missed this webinar or want to share it, a recording is available.</p><p>🔗 Watch the full webinar:</p><div style=\"width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://streamyard.com/e/hh97mwrqjznv\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" title=Embed recording allowfullscreen style=\"width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;\"></iframe></div><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>Technology can’t replace human connection—but it can <strong>amplify possibility</strong>. Craig reminded us that with the right tools, support, and community, neurodivergent teens don’t just survive transitions—they thrive through them.</p><p>We’re just getting started.</p>",

      "bodyText":"<p>For many neurodivergent individuals, entering or remaining in the workforce presents unique challenges. Whether it’s disclosing a diagnosis, requesting accommodations, or simply understanding your legal protections, navigating the workplace can feel overwhelming. That's why the \"Know Your Rights\" webinar, hosted by Neurodiversity Academy and led by Industrial Relations expert Nicole Walsh, is such a critical resource.</p><p>This article unpacks key insights from that webinar, offering practical advice and empowering information to help neurodivergent employees take control of their workplace experiences.</p><h3>Understanding Neurodivergence in the Workplace</h3><p>Neurodivergence includes conditions such as ADHD, autism, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other cognitive or neurological differences. These aren’t deficits — they’re different ways of thinking, perceiving, and interacting with the world. Unfortunately, many workplaces still aren’t built with neurodivergence in mind, which means many neurodivergent employees struggle unnecessarily.</p><p>Workplace success isn’t about “fixing” neurodivergent people. It’s about creating environments that allow every employee to thrive. This starts with knowing your legal rights and entitlements — and how to advocate for yourself effectively.</p><h3>Your Legal Rights: The Basics</h3><p>In Australia, neurodivergent employees are protected under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DDA). This federal law prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities — including neurological conditions — in areas like employment, education, access to premises, and the provision of goods and services.</p><p>Under this law, employers are required to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate a worker’s needs. These might include:</p><ul><li>Flexible work hours or remote work options</li><li>Written instead of verbal instructions</li><li>Access to quiet or sensory-friendly workspaces</li><li>Use of assistive technologies or apps</li><li>Adjustments to performance management processes</li></ul><p>These aren’t \"nice to haves\" — they’re legal obligations, as Nicole Walsh strongly emphasised during the session.</p><h3>Do I Have to Disclose My Diagnosis?</h3><p>No — you are not legally required to disclose a diagnosis unless:</p><ul><li>It directly affects your ability to do the job</li><li>There’s a health and safety risk</li><li>It could impact compliance with workplace policies</li></ul><p>Disclosure is deeply personal. But if you require adjustments, you may need to explain the nature of your needs — not necessarily your condition. Nicole advises focusing on function: what helps you do your best work, and what barriers you experience.</p><h3>Requesting Workplace Adjustments: Tips from the Experts</h3><p>Nicole shared these key steps when asking for support:</p><ul><li>Know your needs: Be clear on what helps and what hinders.</li><li>Frame positively: “I work best when…” instead of “I can’t…”</li><li>Keep a record: Submit requests in writing.</li><li>Collaborate: Be open to adjustments being trialled and refined.</li></ul><p>If an employer dismisses or ignores your request, that may constitute discrimination — particularly if it breaches local or state-specific obligations (such as those under Victoria’s Human Rights Charter).</p><h3>When Things Go Wrong: Your Rights to Protection</h3><p>Sadly, neurodivergent employees still experience discrimination — from microaggressions to outright dismissal. As Nicole explained, you don’t have to face that alone. Here are some resources:</p><ul><li>Document everything (emails, conversations, performance reviews)</li><li>Raise concerns internally first, if safe to do so</li><li>Seek external help:<ul><li>JobAccess: jobaccess.gov.au</li><li>Fair Work Ombudsman: fairwork.gov.au</li><li>Human Rights Commissions (state and federal)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Nicole also emphasised the importance of early intervention — don’t wait until things escalate. Reaching out sooner can lead to better outcomes for everyone.</p><h3>The Personal Impact of Supportive Culture</h3><p>What sets good workplaces apart? According to Nicole, it’s leadership and culture — not token programs or posters. She and Will shared stories of workplaces that talked the talk, but failed the neurodivergent community in action.</p><p>In contrast, the most inclusive organisations often don’t make a big show of it — they embed neuro-inclusion into everyday practice, communication, and management. It’s not performative — it’s normal.</p><h3>Disability Discrimination Act Reform: A Chance for Progress</h3><p>One of the most exciting developments Nicole highlighted is the current review of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. For the first time in decades, stakeholders are being invited to submit feedback on how the Act can be strengthened — especially for neurodivergent individuals.</p><p>Nicole and ADHD Australia are working hard behind the scenes to ensure neurodivergent voices are heard in the reform process. To get involved, visit humanrights.gov.au.</p><h3>Workplace Communication Preferences Matter</h3><p>A fascinating takeaway from the Q&A? Neurodivergent individuals often have very specific preferences for communication. Nicole prefers written instructions to avoid information overload. Will shared how verbal voice notes, often intended to be helpful due to his dyslexia, actually created barriers when they weren’t requested.</p><p>Key message: Always ask — don’t assume.</p><h3>Takeaways for Employers</h3><ul><li>Neurodivergent employees don’t need fixing — they need flexibility.</li><li>Leadership must model inclusion — not just delegate it.</li><li>Disclosure is an act of trust — don’t punish it.</li><li>Psychological safety is critical — especially for younger workers entering the workforce for the first time.</li><li>You don’t have to be perfect — you just need to start, listen, and improve.</li></ul><h3>Watch the Full Webinar</h3><p>This article only scratches the surface.

      "bodyText": "<p><strong>By Isabel Gordon</strong></p><p>Taking a gap year was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. After finishing school, I didn’t feel quite ready to head straight into university — something that’s pretty common for teenagers with ADHD. I just felt like I wasn’t ready for uni yet — I needed more time to grow up a bit, and get some real-life experience first.</p><p>That’s what led me to Nozawa Onsen, Japan — a small, traditional mountain town that I knew well, having visited the year before. From December 2024 to March 2025, I worked with Nozawa Hospitality for three months, and it became more than just a job — it was a huge learning experience, filled with growth, new friendships, and record breaking snow!</p><h3>Getting Started</h3><p>Mum and Dad helped me book my flights, and the Shinkansen, but having been to Nozawa previously, I already felt at home in the town. Nozawa is a charming little ski village, with 13 natural hot springs, and a friendly vibe that made it the perfect first place to live and work away from home.</p><p>I was lucky — accommodation and meals were included, along with a communal lift pass so we could enjoy the slopes during time off. I shared a room with two other girls, and that living situation quickly turned into firm friendships. That said, I have to admit — my side of the room was always a total pigsty. I somehow kept it just organized enough to function, but I think my roommates were saints for putting up with the explosion of clothes, gear, and snack wrappers I lived in!</p><h3>Learning the Ropes</h3><p>During training week, my supervisor surprised me by asking outright if I had ADHD. She’d picked up on my energy right away — but instead of seeing it as a negative, she saw it as a strength. I could get tasks done quickly and with enthusiasm, which made me feel understood and supported right from the start.</p><p>The job involved a lot of cleaning and physical work, which actually suited me really well. The routine kept me motivated, and the repetitive nature of tasks helped me stay focused. I’ve always been someone who needs to move — so even in my free time, I’d walk for hours around the village or head to the local gym.</p><h3>A Health Scare I Didn’t Expect</h3><p>One of the biggest challenges I faced during my time in Nozawa was my health. I developed a relentless cough that wouldn’t go away, and just before the end of the year I coughed so hard I heard a pop in my rib cage. On New Year’s Day my friends dragged me to the doctor, and I had broken a rib. It was a complete shock, and I immediately panicked that I might be sent home. I had to have a difficult but honest conversation with my manager, explaining the situation and how worried I was about losing the job. Thankfully, they were incredibly kind and supportive. Instead of sending me home, they just put me on light duties — I swapped out shovelling snow for washing dishes and making beds, and they made sure I wasn’t doing anything that would make the injury worse. That support meant the world to me.</p><h3>Embracing Neurodivergence</h3><p>Being neurodivergent (ND) definitely showed up in different ways during my time there. I struggled a bit with oversharing or being too loud sometimes, but I made a conscious effort to read the room better. Thankfully, my team was accepting, and being ND was never treated as a problem. In fact, it helped me connect with people — I made so many friends I’m still in touch with, including Ursulla, with whom I plan to travel through Europe with!</p><h3>Challenges and Growth</h3><p>One challenge I had was keeping track of my shifts. Although Nozawa Hospitality used a staff app (which was really helpful), the roster changed every week, and I sometimes had trouble remembering when I was supposed to work. Once, I completely forgot a shift and showed up two hours late. I got a stern reprimand, and from then on, I made it a priority to double-check the schedule.</p><p>Having accommodation and meals sorted out made a big difference — it allowed me to focus on the job and settle into the rhythm of seasonal work without added stress.</p><h3>What’s Next?</h3><p>One of the coolest things about working in Nozawa was meeting people from all over the world. A friend I met there shared her experience working at a summer camp in Canada, and I was immediately interested. Thanks to her tip, I applied through CCUSA and was accepted to work as an archery teacher at Camp Arowhon in Canada from June 15 to August 15!</p>",

      "description": "Blueprint Career Development becomes the first Queensland RTO to join Neurodiversity Academy’s Pilot Program, highlighting their leadership in inclusive education and support for neurodivergent learners across vocational training.",
      "header": "Blueprint Leads Queensland in Inclusive Education: A Neuroinclusive Future Begins Here",
      "bodyText": "<p>Neurodiversity Academy is proud to welcome Blueprint Career Development as the first Queensland Registered Training Organisation (RTO) to join our Neurodiversity Pilot Program. This exciting milestone celebrates Blueprint’s leadership in learner-focused education and marks a powerful shift toward a more inclusive future for vocational training in the state.</p><p>Blueprint has always been about people first. For over 22 years, they’ve gone beyond ticking compliance boxes or chasing enrolment numbers. Instead, their philosophy centres on ensuring that every learner is respected, supported, and positioned for success — from enrolment to employment and everything in between.</p><p>Now, by joining the Neurodiversity Pilot Program, Blueprint is formalising what they’ve been doing for years: investing in inclusive practices, putting learners first, and leading by example.</p><h3>Why Blueprint?</h3><p>Blueprint didn’t join the Pilot by chance — they were chosen because of who they are and what they stand for.</p><p>In every interaction, Blueprint shows a deep commitment to:</p><ul><li>Student-centred learning</li><li>Professional integrity</li><li>Accessible training experiences</li><li>Open dialogue and growth</li></ul><p>With more than two decades of experience as a registered training organisation, Blueprint has refined its approach to meet the evolving needs of diverse learners. Their longevity is a testament to their adaptability and the trust they’ve built across industries, communities, and individual learners alike.</p><h3>Understanding Neurodiversity in Education</h3><p>Neurodiversity describes the natural differences in how people think, learn, and process the world. It includes individuals with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia, Tourette Syndrome, and many other cognitive profiles.</p><p>For these learners, mainstream education often presents invisible hurdles:</p><ul><li>Sensory overload</li><li>Rigid timetables</li><li>Poorly designed assessments</li><li>One-size-fits-all instruction</li><li>Social anxiety or fear of disclosure</li></ul><p>These challenges can lead to disengagement, anxiety, and reduced confidence — not due to lack of ability, but because the system hasn’t been designed with them in mind.</p><p>Blueprint recognises this. They are not waiting for policies to catch up — they are already asking:</p><p>“How can we adapt our courses to be more accessible?”<br>“What supports can we offer that actually help?”<br>“How do we make sure our learners feel heard, respected, and safe?”</p><p>This mindset isn’t just powerful — it’s transformational.</p><h3>Inclusion in Practice at Blueprint</h3><p>Blueprint’s inclusion efforts aren’t hidden in the background — they’re embedded into how they work every day. Their participation in the Neurodiversity Pilot Program allows them to review, refine, and elevate these efforts with external support and feedback.</p><p>Some of the key areas where Blueprint is already leading include:</p><h4>1. Staff Capability and Culture</h4><p>Their team embraces learning and reflection. Staff participate in ongoing training around inclusive communication, neurodivergent learning profiles, trauma-informed practice, and mental health awareness. Importantly, they create space to apply what they learn, discussing how it translates into daily delivery.</p><h4>2. Accessible Learning Design</h4><p>Blueprint considers how content is structured and delivered — both online and face-to-face. They’re working on:</p><ul><li>Breaking down complex instructions</li><li>Using clear, supportive language</li><li>Offering multiple ways for learners to engage with content</li><li>Making assessments flexible where possible</li></ul><h4>3. Sensory-Aware Environments</h4><p>In both physical and digital settings, Blueprint is mindful of sensory triggers. From lighting and noise levels to screen layout and pacing, they consider how to make their learning environments more comfortable — particularly for learners with sensory sensitivities.</p><h4>4. Support Systems That Work</h4><p>Blueprint doesn’t rely on learners to ask for help — they build support into the journey. This includes:</p><ul><li>Clear onboarding processes</li><li>Proactive check-ins</li><li>Respectful communication when adjustments are needed</li><li>Options for breaks, extensions, or alternative assessment formats</li></ul><p>They understand that for neurodivergent learners, consistency, trust, and transparency are key.</p><h3>What Does Endorsement Mean?</h3><p>Through the Pilot, Blueprint is working toward becoming a formally endorsed provider with Neurodiversity Academy.</p><p>Our endorsement process is not about competition or status — it’s about recognising what’s working and helping providers go further.</p><p>An endorsed provider is one that has:</p><ul><li>Demonstrated evidence of inclusive practices</li><li>Reflected on areas for growth</li><li>Built internal systems that support neurodivergent learners</li><li>Engaged with feedback from experts, learners, and the community</li></ul><p>Importantly, there are no endorsement tiers — organisations are either “endorsed” or “not yet endorsed.”</p><p>Blueprint is currently progressing through this process, compiling evidence, participating in review meetings, and receiving tailored guidance from our team. They are not waiting to “get it perfect” — they’re using the process as a roadmap for continuous improvement.</p><h3>Blueprint’s Role in the National Conversation</h3><p>Blueprint is the first RTO in Queensland to join the Neurodiversity Pilot, but they are not alone. The program also includes organisations in:</p><ul><li>Victoria, where creative and design-focused RTOs are exploring flexible learning for neurodivergent students</li><li>Western Australia, where regional and adult-focused providers are building inclusive pathways for diverse learners</li></ul><p>Together, these organisations are shaping a national framework for what inclusive vocational education can look like in practice.</p><p>Blueprint’s participation ensures Queensland is represented in this movement. Their insights, innovation, and leadership are contributing to a bigger picture — one where learners from all over Australia can access training that values who they are, not just how well they perform on paper.</p><h3>Impact for Students and Families</h3><p>For neurodivergent students — and their families — choosing the right training provider is more than a logistical decision. It’s an emotional one. They want to know:</p><ul><li>Will I be judged or misunderstood?</li><li>Will the provider be flexible if I need support?</li><li>Can I trust them to follow through on what they say?</li></ul><p>Blueprint is building that trust. As they move toward endorsement, they are strengthening their position as a provider of choice for students who often fall through the cracks elsewhere.</p><p>Students referred to Blueprint through the Neurodiversity Academy platform will know they are joining a provider that:</p><ul><li>Has taken the time to understand diverse needs</li><li>Welcomes difference</li><li>Doesn’t just talk about inclusion — they live it</li><li>Offers real supports, not just brochures</li></ul><p>This has enormous ripple effects: stronger student confidence, improved completion rates, greater wellbeing, and increased access to employment pathways.</p><h3>Why This Work Matters</h3><p>Inclusion is not about being “nice” — it’s about being effective. When learners feel safe, seen, and supported, everyone benefits:</p><ul><li>Educators feel more confident and connected to their work</li><li>Students thrive and are more likely to finish their qualifications</li><li>Employers gain skilled workers who’ve been set up for success</li><li>Training providers improve their reputation, referrals, and retention</li></ul><p>Blueprint understands this at a fundamental level. They know that inclusion isn’t just a value — it’s a strategy.</p><p>And in a time when many RTOs are struggling with retention, engagement, and reputation, their approach offers a model others can learn from.</p><h3>Looking Ahead</h3><p>As Blueprint continues their journey through the Pilot Program, they’re not just focused on endorsement — they’re focused on building an organisation where inclusion becomes the norm, not the exception.</p><p>They are:</p><ul><li>Gathering student feedback</li><li>Embedding inclusive design into their course materials</li><li>Supporting staff through new training</li><li>Building bridges between intention and action</li></ul><p>And they’re doing it all with transparency, humility, and genuine curiosity.</p><p>This is what leadership looks like — not having all the answers, but being willing to ask the questions, listen deeply, and take action.</p><h3>Final Thoughts: A Provider Worth Watching</h3><p>Blueprint Career Development is showing Queensland — and the nation — that inclusive education is not only possible, but powerful.</p><p>Their decision to join the Neurodiversity Academy Pilot Program is an act of leadership, vision, and deep care. They’re not waiting for someone else to define best practice — they are becoming it.</p><p>We are honoured to work alongside them, and we can’t wait to see what they achieve next.</p>",
